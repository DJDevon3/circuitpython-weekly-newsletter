## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/20201013/20201013bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Over the last week, I worked on filling out the MCP2515 CircuitPython library and have it ready for release after a few tweaks get the OK from Jeff. I was also able to do some more testing of the prototype CAN FeatherWing and was able to successfully snoop on traffic between an ODB dongle and my car! There is still work to be done to allow for decoding the higher level protocols being used, but it’s a start!

[![Bryan](../assets/20201013/20201013bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I also wrote a CircuitPython library for the TLA2024 4-channel 12-bit ADC from TI. This is an adorable little chip that packs a good amount of capability in a small package. In addition to single-ended measurements of each of the four channels, it supports differential measurement between several different combinations of inputs. And it’s relatively inexpensive! Simple to use, capable, small and inexpensive, this little helper can add digital measurement of analog signals in existing and new projects with minimal hassle or expense.

**Jeff**

We now have a second canio implementation merged into the core, this time for the STM32F405 feather and other boards featuring the STM32F405 microcontroller.  To use it, you also need an external CAN transceiver chip such as the NXP TJA1051 as well as other device(s) that also talk a CAN protocol.

Aside from my work on CAN bus, I've also been fixing bugs in CircuitPython and moving us closer to a stable release of version 6.  In particular, another Pull Request I made this week was to fix the crashes users experienced with RGBMatrix in 6.0.0.alpha.1.  This was quickly followed by the alpha.2 release.

**Kattni**

This week I updated of the the LED matrix guides to feature the new Matrix Portal. Search the Learn system for Matrix Portal to find a number of projects to get you started. I also added a CircuitPython page to the 128x64 OLED FeatherWing guide as we now have SH1107 support in CircuitPython.

I soldered up a QT Py Haxpress - the first time I've ever soldered a chip or really anything that tiny. Bonus points: it works!

[![Kattni](../assets/20201013/20201013kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I am working on testing the LED Animation library with the Haxpress, which has been successful so far, running individual animations separately. I tested using the LED Animation library with the base QT Py and, unfortunately, the library doesn't fit, so it's not an option.
 
I'm writing up a QT Py and NeoPixels guide to get you started with using LEDs on your tiny new board. It will cover wiring, example code for using NeoPixels with your base QT Py, and a section on using the LED Animation library with the QT Py Haxpress. Keep an eye out for that!

**Lucian**

This past week I added the AnalogIO functions to the ESP32-S2 port, the Analog to Digital converter (ADC) and Digital to Analog converter (DAC) respectively. The ADC was definitely the trickier of the two - most ADCs on embedded boards are not especially accurate, and the ESP32-S2 in particular has some serious issues when using raw data directly. Un-modified, the ADC's range of voltage readings has several non-linear regions, and has difficulty hitting the extreme ends of the range, 0 and 3.3V (known as "rail to rail" readings).

To get around this, Espressif's IoT Development Framework (known as the ESP-IDF) contains software to automatically compensate and correct issues in the ADC. However, this particular module wasn't available in the version of the ESP-IDF we were using, which necessitated a complicated update involving a lot of header file changes and binary searching of commits to find an IDF version that wouldn't break USB. Luckily it all seems more or less dealt with now and we should have Analog capability on the ESP32 by the end of the week.

Meanwhile, much as it was on the STM32, the DAC additions were so simple they didn't even require notes, much less debugging. Something about DACs... their implementation always seems as proportionally easy as the ADCs are annoying.

And finally, for the STM32, we've started to mark the F4 series as stable in releases, alongside the SAMD and nRF series of SoCs. STM32 support has been maturing for over a year now, so the guide for the Feather F405 has also been updated to reflect the new modules we support and incorporate user feedback. This month, I'll be revisiting some of the final modules that remain unsupported on ST, such as TouchIO and RotaryIO, to see if we can't get those wrapped up as well.

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on finishing up the [BrainCraft HAT guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-braincraft-hat-easy-machine-learning-for-raspberry-pi.). It was started by Ladyada, so I went through and tested the parts she wrote and added more to the guide. 

I also worked on updating the MatrixPortal library to support more hardware such as the RGB Matrix FeatherWings. Even though there aren't enough pins to use the Airlift FeatherWing, you can still use the automatic initialization of the Matrix and I've heard with some creative wiring, you can also get the Airlift breakout to work with it.

**Scott**

This week I've focused on getting the iMX RT 1011 Metro debugged and working. The Metro ESP32-S2 is going as well. It's exciting to prep new platforms for CircuitPython and see Adafruit release hardware for it.

One side project I did was a [SPI Flash command analyzer for Saleae Logic 2](https://github.com/adafruit/Logic2-SPIFlash).

Next week, I'll be trying to squash the remaining bugs for 6.0.0's stable release and collaborating on deep sleep support.
