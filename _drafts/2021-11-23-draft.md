## ESP32-S3 mini modules make for an easy 'S3 Feather

[![ESP32-S3 Feather](../assets/20211123/20211123s3.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVoeIhUUi78)

Adafruit picked up some ESP32-S3 Mini modules from Digi-Key and surprise! They are pin compatible with the S2 Mini modules. That means they were able to upgrade their ESP32-S2 Feather to use the newest dual-core+BLE chipset. All the pins have been tested, NeoPixel works and so does I2C… they are fabricating some of these and will have some for the Adafruit shop as soon as Adafruit can get a reel from Espressif - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/11/15/esp32-s3-mini-modules-make-for-an-easy-s3-feather/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVoeIhUUi78).

## Wirelessly Code your Bluetooth Device with CircuitPython

[![Wirelessly Code your Bluetooth Device with CircuitPython](../assets/20211123/20211123blue.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/wirelessly-code-your-bluetooth-device-with-circuitpython/device-setup)

Did you know you can transfer files over BLE? This is the basis for being able to edit CircuitPython files directly on your device.

Adafruit has been working on a new web-based Code Editor for CircuitPython. This allows you to edit files directly on your Bluetooth devices using just the Chrome web browser without installing any additional software. The great thing about this code editor is it is written completely in JavaScript, so it only runs on your computer and none of your data is ever uploaded to a server - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/wirelessly-code-your-bluetooth-device-with-circuitpython/device-setup) and [https://code.circuitpython.org/](https://code.circuitpython.org/).

## Meet the Maker: Anne Barela

[![Meet the Maker](../assets/20211123/20211123anne.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/11/18/hackspace-magazine-issue-49-meet-the-maker-anne-barela-circuitpython-hackspacemag-raspberry_pi-anne_engineer/)

Adafruit engineer Anne Barela was interviewed for the latest issue of [HackSpace Magazine, Issue 49](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.com/issues/49).

> If you’ve ever programmed anything in CircuitPython and understood the instructions first time, you probably have Anne Barela to thank. She’s a consulting engineer at Adafruit, where she puts her vast array of experience into helping people make cool stuff that ‘just works’. She’s had her work go into space on the Shuttle, she helped make sure the world’s computers didn’t melt when the clocks reset to zero in the year 2000, and she’s a big fan of open source. We got a bit flustered when we spoke to her to be honest – where do you start with a career that’s included Caltech, Hewlett-Packard, NASA, Boeing, and the US Diplomatic Service? So, we started with something we can all understand: CircuitPython.

You can read about Anne, her varied professions, her making trajectory and what she’s doing now in the latest HackSpace Magazine - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/11/18/hackspace-magazine-issue-49-meet-the-maker-anne-barela-circuitpython-hackspacemag-raspberry_pi-anne_engineer/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211123/20211123bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211123/20211123pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211123/20211123pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211123/20211123pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211123/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **341**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_asyncio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_asyncio)

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

We recently did some updates to how the library testing works across all of the libraries, and that means there's too many updated libraries to list this week!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made our latest beta release, CircuitPython 7.1.0-beta.0, on November 11. Try it out and let us know of any issues.

7.1.0-beta.0 contains support for asyncio. I've started writing a guide about using asyncio in CircuitPython: you can check out the [draft so far](https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython/overview?preview_token=di81p2zLknUEEkeM-57bPw). Here's an example of blinking two LEDs independently:

```py
import asyncio
import board
import digitalio

async def blink(pin, interval, count):
    with digitalio.DigitalInOut(pin) as led:
        led.switch_to_output(value=False)
        for i in range(count):
            led.value = True
            await asyncio.sleep(interval)       # Don't forget the "await"!
            led.value = False
            await asyncio.sleep(interval)       # Don't forget the "await"!

async def main():
    led1_task = asyncio.create_task(blink(board.D1, 0.25, 10))
    led2_task = asyncio.create_task(blink(board.D2, 0.1, 20))
    await asyncio.gather(led1_task, led2_task)  # Don't forget the "await"!
    print("done")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Kattni**

This week I finally published the new pages in the [Welcome to CircuitPython][(https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython) guide. There is a new [How Do I Learn Python?](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/how-do-i-learn-python) page that has links to resources to help you learn Python. So, that update is now complete. Check it out if you're new to CircuitPython, or if you're interested in seeing the latest revision of the guide.

Next up is the Feather ESP32-S2 guide. Keep an eye out for that!

I updated the [Adafruit CircuitPython DisplayIO SH1107](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_SH1107) library to support the new [Adafruit Monochrome 1.12" 128x128 OLED Graphic Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5297). It now supports the new display and includes a basic example including text and basic shapes.

[PLEASE VERIFY THE GUIDE LINKED BELOW HAS BEEN PUBLISHED BEFORE INCLUDING THE NEXT SECTION]

I also published the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-monochrome-1-12-in-128x128-oled) for the new OLD display. It includes everything you need to get started with your new display including an overview, pinouts, downloads resources, and examples in both CircuitPython and Arduino.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished writing a guide on using the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.com). This is a web-based code editor that makes use of Web Bluetooth to be able to edit code directly on your device without any software besides the Chrome Web Browser. While writing the guide, I discovered that the Code Editor ran just fine on Linux and Windows, so I made sure to include directions for connecting with those operating systems as well. You can check out the learn guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/wirelessly-code-your-bluetooth-device-with-circuitpython.

**Scott**

Similar to last week, I've been working to wrap up the CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi work to get an initial version in. I filled out the `board` module with pins, added `board.DISPLAY` and made it possible to resize the displayio framebuffer shown on the display. I've still got a tricky issue to solve on the Pi Zero 2W when the CIRCUITPY drive is going. I'm also working to get the Pi builds going in the continuous integration system (CI) on GitHub Actions. Once it's going, we'll build new versions every commit and also auto-release the files.
