## Sony Backs Maker of Raspberry Pi Computers With Funding and Access to AI Chips

[![Sony Backs Raspberry Pi](../assets/20230418/20230418sony.jpg)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/12/sony-backs-raspberry-pi-with-fresh-funding-access-to-ai-chips.html)

Sony Semiconductor Solutions has announced an investment in Raspberry Pi Ltd, the for-profit arm of the Raspberry Pi empire, telegraphing hopes that it will be able to make its AITRIOS edge artificial intelligence (edge AI) platform the go-to way to boost the single-board computers' capabilities for low-power on-device machine learning. The firm raised the cash at the same $500 million valuation it was worth in a 2021 funding round. The company has become a more active player in the enterprise — in a typical year, roughly 70% of its sales now come from commercial customers embedding its products into factories or consumer devices - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/12/sony-backs-raspberry-pi-with-fresh-funding-access-to-ai-chips.html) and [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/sony-invests-in-raspberry-pi-aims-to-add-its-aitrios-edge-ai-platform-to-the-ecosystem-2da89121be26).

## PyCon US Coming Next Week: CircuitPython-Related Activities

[![PyCon US 2023](../assets/20230418/pycon2023.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2023/)

[PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/) is coming up in Salt Lake City, Utah USA April 21 - 23 with Development Sprints April 24 - 27. Adafruit CircuitPython team members be there hosting events! Kattni Rembor and Jeff Epler will be present, along with a few well-known community members. 

Kattni and Jeff will be managing Open Spaces during the conference. The location and time is yet to be determined, but will be known when the conference begins. These Open Spaces will give folks an introduction to CircuitPython via the Circuit Playground Express. There will be a Quickstart worksheet available to get started easily, and Kattni & Jeff will there to help. Kattni will be bringing some fun extras as well. Everyone is welcome to attend!

Kattni will be hosting three days of Development Sprints from 8am-5pm on Monday April 24 through Wednesday April 26. Jeff will be joining on Monday. The location will be determined during the conference. The Sprints are an opportunity to contribute to the CircuitPython project, on the Python side of things, through code and documentation on CircuitPython Libraries. Everyone is welcome; there will still be all of the introduction to CircuitPython hardware, so there will be opportunities for folks at any level to participate.

Kattni states: "If you're attending, please let me know ahead of time in the `#circuitpython-dev` channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord), or come find us around the conference. We'd love to meet up! We're looking forward to PyCon 2023, and we hope you are too! See you there!" - [PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/).

The latest episode was released (date) and features (guest).  They and Paul talk {subject} – [Show List](https://circuitpythonshow.com/episodes/all).

## Project of the Week: The PYPRCA CircuitPython Calculator/Computer

[![PYPRCA](../assets/20230418/20230418potw.jpg)](https://twitter.com/bobricius/status/1646646062449344512)

[![PYPRCA](../assets/20230418/20230418potw2.jpg)](https://twitter.com/bobricius/status/1646646062449344512)

PYPRCA is a Python programable calculator and CircuitPython computer. It has a dedicated numerical key block for better native input of numbers. It also has a
QWERTY key set for writing programs. Functions like SIN and COS are typed out rather than using shift buttons. 

Features:
- 2.8" color TFT IPS Display
- keyboard (7x7)
- Raspberry PICO or W
- SD card
- GROVE GPIO
- Speaker 
- A simple quadratic equation solver
 
It is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico. It's a bit shorter and wider than a Numworks calculator - [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/bobricius/status/1646646062449344512) and [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/190308-pyprca-python-programmable-calculator-computer).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230418/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).
