## Sony Backs Maker of Raspberry Pi Computers With Funding and Access to AI Chips

[![Sony Backs Raspberry Pi](../assets/20230418/20230418sony.jpg)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/12/sony-backs-raspberry-pi-with-fresh-funding-access-to-ai-chips.html)

Sony Semiconductor Solutions has announced an investment in Raspberry Pi Ltd, the for-profit arm of the Raspberry Pi empire, telegraphing hopes that it will be able to make its AITRIOS edge artificial intelligence (edge AI) platform the go-to way to boost the single-board computers' capabilities for low-power on-device machine learning. The firm raised the cash at the same $500 million valuation it was worth in a 2021 funding round. The company has become a more active player in the enterprise — in a typical year, roughly 70% of its sales now come from commercial customers embedding its products into factories or consumer devices - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/12/sony-backs-raspberry-pi-with-fresh-funding-access-to-ai-chips.html) and [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/sony-invests-in-raspberry-pi-aims-to-add-its-aitrios-edge-ai-platform-to-the-ecosystem-2da89121be26).

## PyCon US Coming Next Week: CircuitPython-Related Activities

[![PyCon US 2023](../assets/20230418/pycon2023.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2023/)

[PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/) is coming up in Salt Lake City, Utah USA April 21 - 23 with Development Sprints April 24 - 27. Adafruit CircuitPython team members be there hosting events! Kattni Rembor and Jeff Epler will be present, along with a few well-known community members. 

Kattni and Jeff will be managing Open Spaces during the conference. The location and time is yet to be determined, but will be known when the conference begins. These Open Spaces will give folks an introduction to CircuitPython via the Circuit Playground Express. There will be a Quickstart worksheet available to get started easily, and Kattni & Jeff will there to help. Kattni will be bringing some fun extras as well. Everyone is welcome to attend!

Kattni will be hosting three days of Development Sprints from 8am-5pm on Monday April 24 through Wednesday April 26. Jeff will be joining on Monday. The location will be determined during the conference. The Sprints are an opportunity to contribute to the CircuitPython project, on the Python side of things, through code and documentation on CircuitPython Libraries. Everyone is welcome; there will still be all of the introduction to CircuitPython hardware, so there will be opportunities for folks at any level to participate.

Kattni states: "If you're attending, please let me know ahead of time in the `#circuitpython-dev` channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord), or come find us around the conference. We'd love to meet up! We're looking forward to PyCon 2023, and we hope you are too! See you there!" - [PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/).

## Python Software Foundation is Worried About Looming EU Cybersecurity Rules

[![EU Cybersecurity Rules](../assets/20230418/20230418eu.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/12/python_management_eu/)

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is concerned that proposed EU cybersecurity laws will leave open source organizations and individuals unfairly liable for distributing incorrect code - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/12/python_management_eu/).

> "If the proposed law is enforced as currently written, the authors of open-source components might bear legal and financial responsibility for the way their components are applied in someone else's commercial product," the PSF said in a [statement](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-eus-proposed-cra-law-may-have.html) shared by executive director Deb Nicholson.

## How to Build Your Own Raspberry Pi Watch

[![How to build your own Raspberry Pi watch](../assets/20230418/20230418watch.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/how-to-build-your-own-raspberry-pi-watch/)

The Raspberry Pi Maker in Residence, Toby, and the Head of Documentation, Alasdair, were talking about the idea of a Raspberry Pi RP2040-powered watch. While they were looking around to see if anyone else had already come up with the idea and made one, they stumbled across an [RP2040-based 1.28-inch TFT display and watch board on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/adz1122/pi-pico-rp2040-128-inch-tft-display-watch-board/). 

Read about how the duo tracked down the code and show how one can program the watch themselves in CircuitPython or MicroPython - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/how-to-build-your-own-raspberry-pi-watch/).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This week I did some testing and researching of the BNO55 and BNO85 sensors. These sensors do not work well on certain microcontrollers, and on others they are fine. It turns out they sometimes violate the I2C bus protocol. Some I2C implementations are more tolerant of these violations than others. I added warnings to the Learn Guides for these sensors for now. It might also be possible to do some silent error recovery inside the CircuitPython libraries, but for now, we are warning the potential users.

**Kattni**

This week I added the CircuitPython Essentials pages to the Feather RP2040 RFM69 guide. This includes the usual, but also includes a simple radio demo. The demo requires two Feathers, and when the appropriate code is loaded onto each one, you can press the Boot button on one, and change the NeoPixel color on the other! Basically, this example shows you how to set up the hardware, and send and receive packets between two modules. That means you have a place to start for any project using the RFM69 module!

Next up is the Adafruit Feather RP2040 RFM95 guide.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa's Project](../assets/20230418/20230418melissa.gif)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

Over the past couple of weeks, I finished working on the [Robotic AI Bear using ChatGPT Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/robotic-ai-bear-using-chatgpt). This was once of the biggest project guides I've worked on and included 3D printing, Disassembly of the bear, electronics, and lots of code. I had a lot of fun making the project and the project and guide turned out well.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on some new capabilities for the pybadger conference badge code to give it an IoT integration and allow it to launch other sample circuitpython scripts from a menu. I'm also still chasing some issues with multiple displays and I've got an improvement for the Monster M4sk library to submit that will attach the backlight to the display initialization so the system will keep it on after code.py finishes.

**Scott**

I've been feeling better this week. I burned out on iMX RT work and got tempted by the new Feather RP2040 DVI. I've added DVI support to CircuitPython. I've proven it works well but have taken a couple shortcuts that I need to fix before creating a PR. Next, I'll get back to the iMX RT work that I have pending.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a guide for the [CircuitPython Wii Classic Controller library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuitpython-wii-classic-controller-library). This library allows you to use a Wii Classic controller connected to a nunchuck breakout with CircuitPython. This is also the first CircuitPython library that I wrote.
Additionally, I've been working on adding U2IF support for a few of the RP2040 "bones" Feathers that have been added to the shop. This lets folks use CPython modules with CircuitPython modules on a desktop computer. It's been a fun learning experience and I'm looking forward to using it in some upcoming projects.
