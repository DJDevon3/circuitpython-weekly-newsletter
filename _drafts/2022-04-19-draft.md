## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220419/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **351**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am working on a number of issues to improve CircuitPython reliability:

- NeoPixel timing on SAMD51 and possibly some other chip families could use tuning. Sometimes the first NeoPixel in a string gets the wrong color. There are multiple parts used for NeoPixels: WS2811, WS2812B, SK6812, and perhaps some others. They have slightly different timing requirements. Each NeoPixel regenerates the timing when passing on data on its output line, so we can observe the timings each kind of NeoPixel likes best. I am measuring the timings on multiple kinds of NeoPixels with my Saleae, adjusting the delays, and re-testing.
- ESP2-S2 I2C is showing long delays (10ms) between transactions, but only at 100 kHz I2C bus speed. Increasing the speed even only slightly removes the long delay. The delay seems related to the FreeRTOS tick interval used in the ESP-IDF.
- ESP32SPI WiFi can fail after a few minutes of intense use when used with the PortalBase library. It does not appear that that the library is doing anything wrong, but it is more complicated that using the base ESP32SPI library, which does not fail after many hours of trials. We need to figure out what is different about how the libraries are doing WiFi.

I wrote a visualization tool that shows the information stored on a floppy disk. It can be a tool to help understand, at a high level, the structure of floppy disk formats. This image shows a Commodore 1541 floppy disk image, as mastered by fluxengine. You can check out the software (on github)[https://github.com/adafruit/fluxvis] or (on pypi)[https://pypi.org/project/fluxvis/].

This past week, I finally had my changes to make use of LittleFS and ESPtool as NPM packages updated in the [WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader](https://adafruit.github.io/WipperSnapper_Firmware_Uploader/). This tools will eventually be integrated into the [Adafruit IO dashboard](https://io.adafruit.com/) itself and this change was an important step in that it cleaned up a lot of the code and also showed proper implementation and tested that it worked.

I also started working on implementing a new MIPI driver for Raspberry Pi Displays. The current FBTFT driver has had issues with each new release of Raspberry Pi OS and this will allow for a more universal driver that should be more stable.

**Tim**

I continued my tinkering with "inflated" TileGrids from last week. These will allow us to use small 3x3 spritesheets and generate larger sized TileGrids from them by repeating the middle row and column tiles as needed to reach the desired size. The initial use-case I have in mind for this is a new TabLayout displayio widget but I think the functionality will end up having many other nifty uses for displayio based graphics. 

As part of my work on this, I dove into the core code for TileGrid and started working on an enhancement to allow the bitmap to be changed after the TileGrid is created, in the TabLayout this will be used to visually differentiate "active" and "inactive" tabs. This week we're having a CircuitPython Library focused edition of the Deep Dive stream, we'll be joined by special guest Kattni to discuss all things related to Library development.

**Liz**

This past week I wrapped up the Doomscroll and Chill - A Wireless BLE Scroll Wheel Remote Learn Guide. I think folks will find it to be a good resource for using the scroll wheel as an HID shortcut interface. Next, I will be working on a controller for the classic game Glider. It will involve an actual paper airplane. I'm also going to begin exploring laser harps.
