## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there was one) new boards added:

- [BrainBoardz Neuron](https://circuitpython.org/board/brainboardz_neuron/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230228/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.3 on Thursday, February 23. This fixes some problems that have been present for a long time in the 8.0.0-beta line, and a few new fixes. We encountered some more things to fix and there will be an 8.0.4 before long.

8.1.0 is getting closer, but we needed to get some space back on smaller builds before merging everything in.

I am writing a Learn Guide about safe mode, including how the new safemode.py feature works.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished up making a Pull Request for the CircuitPython installer, which is currently in the process of being merged. I worked mostly on stability and user interface improvements. Once it is live, it will likely have some bugs that were caught yet, but it should improve over time.

**Tim**

This week I tested some more PRs for the MiniMQTT library and the Wiznet ethernet library. Over in the core I tested the new support for animated GIFs and finished up handling some feedback for the displayio module argument validation that I started prior. I've also been experimenting to learn how the ColorConverter class works together with Bitmap and how they differ in functionality compared to Palette. Once I've got my head wrapped around it I'd like to add to the displayio learn guide a section that explains what it can do and how to use it.

**Jeff**

The guide I was wrapping up last week has now been published, showing how to use the OV5640 camera breakout with CircuitPython.

Besides that I also helped mop up a bug that affected non-blocking SSL connections on the Raspberry Pi Pico W, including mqtt. Big thanks to community member Dave Putz who wrote an initial version of the fix, and to everyone who helped with info about the issue.

**Scott**

This week I've wrapped up PWMOut fixes on the iMX RT and continued working on the Bangle.js 2 PR. Since it was opened, the amount of free space in the main branch has gone down. This meant that the new changes no longer fit. So, I'm implementing a suggestion of Jeff's to free up some more space. (Thanks Jeff!)

I've also been reading up SWO and TRACE from the iMX RT as a way to analyze the effectiveness of our cache and memory layout. I'll be adding a performance testing page to my upcoming CP implementer's guide.

**Liz**

This week I worked on some new product documentation. The 2.13" eInk display breakout now has an EYESPI connector, so I [added a page to the guide detailing how to use it](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-13-eink-display-breakouts-and-featherwings/eyespi). This is the first eInk display in the shop with the new EYESPI connector. I also updated the [LCD Backpack guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-spi-lcd-backpack) for the new STEMMA version.
