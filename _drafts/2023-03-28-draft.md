## 100 CircuitPython Community Libraries!

[![100 CircuitPython Community Libraries!](../assets/20230328/20230328clib.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/22/100-circuitpython-community-libraries-circuitpython-python-circuitpython/)

The CircuitPython community reached a big milestone together! There are now 100 libraries in the CircuitPython Community Bundle! CircuitPython libraries are separate files designed to work with CircuitPython code.

The CircuitPython Community Bundle contain all the available libraries for CircuitPython that have been submitted by the CircuitPython community at large. These libraries are updated and maintained by their community authors. A huge thanks to all the authors and the folks that make CircuitPython easy and friendly for everyone. A special thanks to [CedarGroveStudios](https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios) for [submitting](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/pull/145) the 100th library: [CircuitPython_AD5293](https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/CircuitPython_AD5293) – a CircuitPython driver for the AD5293 digital potentiometer.

The full list of all the CircuitPython libraries contained in the library bundles (Adafruit + Community) can be found on the [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) [libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) page - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/22/100-circuitpython-community-libraries-circuitpython-python-circuitpython/).

## Clippy gets smarter with Raspberry Pi and ChatGPT

[![Clippy gets smarter with Raspberry Pi and ChatGPT](../assets/20230328/20230328clip.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/clippy-gets-smarter-with-raspberry-pi-and-chatgpt/)

Everyone is asking if ChatGPT is actually Clippy in disguise. Well, what better way to find out than building a ChatGPT-powered Clippy? ChatGPT in a box runs Azure Speech Services. It listens to what you ask and runs it through ChatGPT, which then sends back an answer for Azure Speech Services to say out loud, making it seems as though Clippy is talking to you.

David Packman’s Raspberry Pi project uses an Adafruit CRICKIT HAT, which gives Clippy a lot of functionality, including running speakers to give it a voice. Programming is with Python and the Adafruit Blinka compatibility layer for using CircuitPython code - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/clippy-gets-smarter-with-raspberry-pi-and-chatgpt/), [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/david-packman/clippygpt-6a683a#overview), and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/6OYGeOwd6RY).

SVG is a horribly complex format and an overkill for most projects. The specification includes way too many edge cases so implementing a new SVG renderer will always have drawbacks or missing pieces. TinyVG tries to be simpler. Fewer features, but powerful enough to cover 90% of use cases - [tinyvg.tech](https://tinyvg.tech/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm wrangling the release of CircuitPython 8.1.0-beta.1 now. As I write this, it looks like we'll include at least 70 pull requests since beta.0, and have a good collection of fixes and enhancements.

I've contributed several miscellaneous fixes. On the build side, I changed the way we fetch submodules in a CircuitPython clone to use git "partial clones", specifically "blobless" clones. We used to use shallow clones for submodules. These had incomplete information about the git commit tree, which made it difficult to move between, or find tags or branches. Partial clones are better: they fetch metadata or commits lazily, but all the information is available on demand, so they appear as if they are complete.

**Kattni**

I recently returned after being out for a bit. I got some misc out of the way before beginning the guide for the Adafruit Feather RP2040 DVI microcontroller. If you pick up one of these nifty boards, keep an eye out for the guide!

Next up will be getting a head start on the Adafruit Feather RP2040 RFM by getting it added to CircuitPython, and creating the Fritzing object and PrettyPins diagram!

**Melissa**

[![Melissa Project](../assets/20230328/20230328melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I took the ChatGPT Voice assistant and placed it inside a motorized toy bear. To keep everything nice and neat, I designed a 3D-printable case to house the Raspberry Pi and all of the components. This was one of the more complex things I've 3D modeled and am very happy with how it turned out. I showed off a demonstration of the bear at its current progress on [Adafruit's March 22nd SHOW and TELL](https://www.youtube.com/live/m7rZJALOhrc?feature=share&t=342).

**Tim**

I finished up the diskinfo API for web workflow. Working on that pushed the boundaries of my knowledge of core development out a bit further, so it was a great opportunity to learn more about "under the hood" of CircuitPython. I begun work on making a way for displayio Group to know the  height and width of the rectangle that it occupies on the display so that it can more easily be used with touch screens to test whether a user has touched within the bounds of a Group or not. There is still much work to do in order to get all of the measurements working correctly, especially when considering the scale and possible negative positions of children elements.

It took a bit of time, but the pull request to add support for I2S Audio Output on the i.MX RT family microcontrollers is finally ready for folks to kick the tires. As I write this there are still a few items to check and refine before merging it, but it'll be in "latest" builds some time soon.

I've tested the feature only on the Metro M7 with the Maxim MAX98357A I2S amplifier (Adafruit has a breakout board with this chip) but it should work across the whole line of i.MX RT micros, such as the Teensy, and on other I2S DACs and amplifiers.

One thing I am excited about is that it can mix together at least 12(!) 22kHz wave files from the CIRCUITPY drive at the same time. If you can fit your samples in the 2MB of the CIRCUITPY drive, this looks like it'll be a great board for some sample mixing.

**Scott**

The performance improvements I made for the i.MX RT (Metro M7 1011) will be in the next CircuitPython 8.1 beta. Based on the benchmarks, it's a 2-5x speedup. Now, I'm looking into optimizing our flash accesses to make the worst case where we need data from flash faster. Simply raising the speed to flash from 60MHz to 133MHz seems to be another 0.5x speedup or so. There are a couple other things we could do too.

I'm also working to add support for additional iMX RT chips like the 1050 and 1040. They have more RAM and are a bit faster than the 1011.

This week I did a bit of bug fixing as well. With my 7-color epaper changes I broke tricolor epaper. So, I fixed that yesterday. I also fixed an issue with displaying the CircuitPython terminal because I made the Blinka bitmap data read-only but some code was trying to write to it. 

**Liz**

This week I had two guides go live: the [Metro M7 1011 with AirLift](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m7-with-airlift) and the [MIDI Controlled Robot Lyre with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/midi-controlled-robot-lyre-with-circuitpython). The Metro M7 guide has all of the details you need to get started with the new Metro M7 board. This is the first dev board in the shop that uses the i.MX 1011.

The robot lyre was a long-term project that I'd been slowly making progress on for the past few weeks. It uses a Feather RP2040 running CircuitPython to control 16 servo motors with MIDI. Each servo is mounted directly above a string on the lyre so that it can be plucked when a corresponding MIDI note is received. The hardest part of this project was the CAD design, with some parts needing adjustments of less than a millimeter to find the optimal design. I learned a lot though and am looking forward to more robot instrument projects.
