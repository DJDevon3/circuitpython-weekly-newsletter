## The Latest Python Developers Survey Results Are Out

[![Python Developers Survey Results](../assets/20220607/20220607survey.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/06/python-developers-survey-2021-python-is.html)

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) announced the results of their fifth official annual Python Developers Survey. The work is done each year as a collaborative effort between the PSF and JetBrains. Late last year, more than 23,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200 countries/regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it.

[![Python Developers Survey Results](../assets/20220607/20220607use.jpg)]([https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/06/python-developers-survey-2021-python-is.html](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/#PythonPackaging))

Python is being used by the vast majority (84%) of survey respondents as their primary language and by many others as just one more tool in their box. - [PSF Blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/06/python-developers-survey-2021-python-is.html) and [survey results summary](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/).

## Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10

[![Python 3.11](../assets/20220607/20220607new.jpg)](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/welcome-python-3-11-an-upgrade-to-counter-decades-long-speed-issue/)

Python 3.11.0 has reached beta 1 status and is close to release. It is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, developers measured a 1.25x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. How is this being done? Python 3.11 is the first release to benefit from a project called Faster CPython, where CPython is the standard version of the interpreter. Faster CPython is a project funded by Microsoft, whose members include Python inventor Guido van Rossum - [Analytics Insight](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/welcome-python-3-11-an-upgrade-to-counter-decades-long-speed-issue/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220607/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **357**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Kattni**

This past week has been starting a few things at once to accommodate one ending up on hold for reasons. I'm close to finished with the QT Py ESP32 Pico, but need the hardware to complete it. The QT Py will be here tomorrow. 

I worked on getting GIFs of double-pressing reset on various CircuitPython boards to get into the bootloader for adding to the WipperSnapper app. Getting the rhythm right is one of the biggest support issues with anything involving putting boards into the bootloader, and WipperSnapper relies on this. We're hoping that the addition of the GIFs will help alleviate that.

Next up is a guide on fancifying your GitHub profile. There are a number of tools that can get you through using Markdown to add all sorts of information to your profile in simple and more involved ways. This guide will cover some of the available options and link to many more.

**Melissa**

This past week I did some work on the [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) website. First I added a bunch of additional checks that are performed on new [Pull Requests](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/pulls) that will check things such as the image dimensions and that required fields have values that make sense. I also went through and fixed issues that were caught with these checks on the current boards. This should make reviewing any new boards much easier.

The other thing I did was to add issue labels to the [open issues under the contributing section](https://circuitpython.org/contributing/open-issues) of the website. This will make it easier to see all open issues related to CircuitPython at a glance.

**Tim**

This week I worked on making the PWM frequency used for the display backlight be an argument that can be set when the display is initialized inside the core. This allows for the PyPortal Titano and any devices using its same display driver chip to have better more accurate control over the backlight, especially at lower brightnesses. The argument is working successfully on the Titano, the last thing to do is update all boards with built-in displays to pass the default value to the new argument during display initialization. 

I'm also working on my core PR to add a `contains` method to TileGrid class so it can be touch interactive, I will complete some minor requested changes for that PR and look into making a similar API for Group object as well.

**Scott**

This week I've been wrapping up my work to optimize the [translation code size](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6440). It trades compile time for code size.

I've also been playing around with changing the CircuitPython's terminal to have a status bar. The status bar would allow us to show all of the different statuses: wifi, ble, usb and usb host. The status bar work is part of the larger web workflow goal which would auto-connect to wifi, advertise with mdns and present a REST API for editing CircuitPython files.

**Liz**

I've been working on some IoT projects this past week. First, I redid the [OpenWeatherMap PyPortal demo project](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-weather-station) to be in portrait mode and to turn the display off and on with the PyPortal's light sensor. It involved rescaling the bitmaps and changing up the coordinates of the text elements. This is for a collaboration project with the Ruiz brothers that will be coming out in a few weeks.

The other IoT adventure I've been on has been using CircuitPython with Microsoft Azure. I'm using the Feather ESP32-S2 TFT with a BME688 sensor. On the TFT screen, I have the temperature, humidity, pressure and battery life data displayed. Every 15 minutes the data is sent up to Microsoft Azure and the TFT shows the timestamp. This learn guide will be out soon and will go through how to setup everything on the Azure side as well.
I'm going to be off next week, but when I return there are some fun music tech/synth projects in the pipeline.
