## Two New CircuitPython Releases

[![Two New CircuitPython Releases](../assets/20220405/20220405cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-2-4-released/)

Two new versions of CircuitPython came out last week - [CircuitPython 7.2.4](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-2-4-released/) and [CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.0](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-3-0-beta-0-released/).

Notable changes to 7.3.0 since 7.2.4:
* Experimental mDNS support.
* USB to Serial/JTAG support for REPL on appropriate boards.
* Initial experimental USB host support.
* Merge MicroPython 1.18 changes.

Notable fixes to 7.2.4 since 7.2.3:
* Enable I2C power by default on Feather ESP32-S2.
* Fix `supervisor.reload()`.

## Adafruit IO is now storing over 1 billion data records

[![Adafruit IO is now storing over 1 billion data records](../assets/20220405/20220405aio.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/01/adafruit-io-is-now-storing-over-1-billion-data-records/)

Adafruit IO has reached a milestone in that it now stores over 1 billion data records.

The interesting part about this is that due to how free accounts work, most of that data rolls over after 30 days and is deleted.

> TOTAL DATA RECORDS 1 Billion (1003060059)

Adafruit continues to grow the infrastructure behind IO to support their free and paid users. They’re adding new features and are looking forward to new users discovering the product.

In the last month, Adafruit has added new dashboard blocks, updated Actions, had major updates to Wippersnapper (with more on the way) and they have more updates planned - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/01/adafruit-io-is-now-storing-over-1-billion-data-records/).

## Linux 5.17 Released

[![Linux 5.17 Released](../assets/20220405/20220405linux.jpg)](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wj4fFjx2pgbGNBM4wJs3=eReZ05EQyprzgT2Jv8qJ2vJg@mail.gmail.com/)

Linux 5.17 was released late last month. Most of it is in drivers (net, usb, drm), with some core networking, and some tooling updates - [Kernel.org](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wj4fFjx2pgbGNBM4wJs3=eReZ05EQyprzgT2Jv8qJ2vJg@mail.gmail.com/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220405/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.2.4 to fix a small number of bugs, and also released CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.0, the first 7.3.x release. 7.3.0-beta.0 includes about 75 pull requests merged since 7.2.x was branched from the main line branch.

I have been fixing bugs and doing reviews. There are still a few more bugs to fix for 7.2.x, and larger number for 7.3.0.

MicroPython recently fixed a number of `asyncio` issues; they will need to be incorporated into our version of the library and the CircuitPython core.

**Jeff**

This past week I actually worked on some CircuitPython bugs! There was an interesting bug on boards with samd51 microcontrollers where, every 3 days, the time could rarely and briefly go backwards by 3 days. There's a fix for it, which we hope to merge soon.

**Kattni**

This week I proofed Liz's first STEMMA QT revision guide completed on her own. She did a wonderful job! 

I had a huge amount of miscellaneous piling up, so I spent a day going through all of that to get it out of the way. They were mostly small things, but they had been collecting for a while.

Finally, I added a MicroPython Setup page to the Feather ESP32 V2 guide. It shows how to blink the LED from the REPL, and how to use Thonny to load a simple WiFi connection demo.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished up two new learn guides. The first one is the [Adafruit 1.47" Round Rectangle TFT Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-47-round-rectangle-tft-display) learn guide and the other one is the [Adafruit 1.9" Color IPS TFT Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-9-color-ips-tft-display).

I also worked on Blinka a bit and updated the `libgpiod_pin` module to work with both older and newer versions of `libgpiod`. The reason this was an issue is because Blinka was still using the older version and they had different APIs. Rather than break it for users by just updating, it made more sense to support both.

**Tim**

This week I made some colorful and fun examples using the `RotatedPolygon` helper class that was created last week. I will be digging further into the core `vectorio` module to try to enable the capability to use the `hidden` property for hiding and showing shapes the same way that `displayio` TileGrids and Groups work. I also created a `PagedLayout` class for the `DisplayIO_Layout` library that provides a very easy to use interface for building multi-page applications and being able to change which page is showing at any given time, ultimately I hope to expand the `PagedLayout` into a `TabLayout` that uses button tabs to allow the user to change between the pages. I hope to use these new widgets to create a new version of the PyPortal Interface learn guide example project that is updated to use asyncio and some of the other newer features in CircuitPython.

**Liz**

Last week I published the [Raspberry Pi Video Synth guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-video-synth-with-blinka-and-processing). I also made a [one-minute video about the project](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CbvDPN3Aw6B/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

Big thanks to Kattni for proofing my first solo STEMMA QT revision guide. I'll be working on my first solo new product guide this week for the TSC2007 STEMMA board. I've also started working on a new project with a QT Py ESP32-S2. I'm using it to control a Pure Data script over a socket. Its final form will be a funky, wireless synth controller.
