Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! A busy week with a surprising amount of activity in the Python on hardware community. New software and so many innovative combinations of hardware plus software. Most of this capability was just something one dreamed about a short while ago. It is the community, driving innovation along with an easing of the chip shortage, which is releasing the floodgates. As we head into summer, I look forward to your projects. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Software Driving Hardware

[![Software Driving Hardware](../assets/20230606/20230606soft.jpg)](https://hackaday.com/2023/06/03/software-driving-hardware/)

Hackaday was talking about Christopher Barnatt’s very insightful analysis of [what the future holds for the Raspberry Pi single board computers](https://hackaday.com/2023/05/31/what-next-for-the-sbc-that-has-everything/) on their [Podcast](https://hackaday.com/2023/06/02/hackaday-podcast-221-the-future-of-the-raspberry-pi-sniffing-a-toothbrush-your-tactical-tool-threshold/). On the one hand, they’re becoming such competent computers that they are beginning to compete with lightweight desktop machines, instead of just being a hacker curiosity.

On the other hand, especially given the shortage and the increase in price that has come with the Pi’s expanding memory endowments, a lot of people who would “just throw in a Raspberry Pi” are starting to think more carefully about their options. 

These days, there is no shortage of microcontrollers that have enough memory – both flash and RAM – to support a higher-level environment like MicroPython. And if you think about it, MicroPython brings to the microcontrollers a lot of what people were using a Raspberry Pi for in projects anyway: a friendly interactive programming environment that was free of the compile-here, flash-there debug cycle. If you’re happy coding Python on a single-board Linux computer, you’ll be more or less happy coding in MicroPython or CircuitPython on a microcontroller - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/06/03/software-driving-hardware/).

## Git 2.41 Released

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This week I've been working on making the fetching of submodules more selective in the CircuitPython repo. The idea is to fetch only the submodules you need. If you're building only for a particular port, there's no reason to fetch all the submodules for every port, which can take minutes.

I've also started to look at Greg Neverov's proposals for `asyncio` again, as we start working on what we want in the 9.0.0 release.

**Kattni**

This week I finished up the Feather RP2040 DVI guide. It was started before the board came out, but there were some issues, so getting the board into the shop was delayed. The guide was set aside, and not dealt with again until the past week. It's completed now! If you picked up one of these nifty boards, check out the guide. It has everything you need to get started, including CircuitPython and Arduino DVI video examples!

Next up in guide land is the CHOC NeoKey breakout, followed by the STEMMA QT Gamepad. Keep an eye out for those coming soon!

**Melissa**

This past week I've been catching up on GitHub issues. I've been focusing on the display issues in the [Raspberry Pi Installer Scripts GitHub repository](https://github.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts). One of the issues that took some time was updating the Display Driver for the 1.14" display so that it fixes the offsets. I started with the source code from the current driver and added the calculations from the old driver and was able to get it working again.

**Tim**

This week I've been going back through typing PRs submitted during pycon that needed additional changes still and doing what I can to move them forward. I also started digging into a `displayio` issue submitted recently that results in hidden objects making the refresh rendering time longer than they would if they were visible, I've attempted a few fixes and had some success in figuring out where the hidden items are taking extra time. It still needs some additional testing and likely a few more changes before it's ready to go.

**Jeff**

Another week, another `synthio` improvement. In a new pull request, the overall FIR filtering is replaced with per note biquad filtering, which is more frequently used in audio synthesis. This allows each sound to have a different filter, which is especially useful for creating percussive effects where a drum might have a low pass filter while a high hat would use a high pass filter. Mark (gamblor) demonstrated this during last week's Show and Tell program.

**Scott**

This week I've been mostly working in the Pyrate code. I added 1-Wire support and am working on UART support. UART is a bit tricky because the pins on the Pyrate board don't support native UART. So, I'm polishing up the PIO code used for UART. That code will allow us to use any pin for TX or RX.

**Liz**

This week I've been working on a synth that uses the ANO rotary encoders. The code is written in CircuitPython with the new synthio module features. It is probably the longest code I've ever written in CircuitPython and it's been super fun adding different modes to show the features in `synthio`. The guide should be live soon along with some demo videos.
