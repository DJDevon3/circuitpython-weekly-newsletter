## Bluetooth Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W Likely Coming in January

[![Bluetooth Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20230110/20230110bt.jpg)](https://twitter.com/aallan/status/1610616300597907456?s=12&t=erdRbaVRnvVnCpDBWD34KA)

Bluetooth Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W is likely coming this month, per a Raspberry Pi team member. It will be in the 1.5.0 release of the Pico C software developer's kit. This should allow for adoption in Python at some point after that - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aallan/status/1610616300597907456?s=12&t=erdRbaVRnvVnCpDBWD34KA), [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/04/raspberry-pi-pico-w-picow-bluetooth-support-coming-this-month-raspberrypi-aallan-raspberry_pi/) and [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-bluetooth-support-is-just-around-the-corner-for-both-c-c-and-micropython-592c42d1170a).

## Raspberry Pi Releases New Autofocus Camera Modules

[![New Autofocus Camera Modules](../assets/20230110/20230110cam.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/)

Raspberry Pi announced Monday the launch of Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. Four different variants of Camera Module 3, in fact, starting at the familiar price of $25. There are new Camera Modules with both visible-light and infrared-sensitive options, and with either a standard or wide field of view (FoV). And in place of the fixed-focus optics of its predecessors, Camera Module 3 provides powered autofocus — which many have requested — allowing you to take crisp images of objects from around 5cm out to infinity - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/).

There is also a new video out discussing the cameras by Kevin McAleer - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/J_CkQ36tVA4).

## CircuitPython in 2023: Let the Devs Know Your Feelings!

[![CircuitPython in 2023](../assets/20230110/20230110cp23.jpg)](url)

As the year starts, the CircuitPython development team would like to take some time to share their goals for CircuitPython in 2023 and beyond. Just like past years (full summary [2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/), and [2022](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/01/thank-you-for-circuitpython2022/)), they’d like everyone in the Python on hardware community to contribute by posting their thoughts to a public place on the internet by Wednesday January 18th, 2023.

Here are a few ways to post:

* a video on YouTube
* a post on the CircuitPython forum
* a blog post on your site
* a post on Mastodon with tags #CircuitPython and #CircuitPython2023
* a Gist on GitHub

They want to hear from you. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2023 and email circuitpython2023@adafruit.com to let them know about your post so they can post it on the Adafruit Blog.

The post can cover any topic related to CircuitPython. See a suggested list and more in the post on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/). This includes any suggestions or comments related to this newsletter.

## SparkFun turns Twenty Years Old

[![SparkFun turns Twenty](../assets/20230110/20230110sf.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/5586)

SparkFun, an open source parts supplier, turned 20 yeard old last week, according to founder Nathan Seidle - [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/5586) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/YQ21ZxW6aoo).

> SparkFun turns 20 years old this week, and next year I’ll have worked at SparkFun half of my life. Since SparkFun opened its doors, there was always work to do. The challenge of getting a little faster to market, writing a little cleaner code, open sourcing more technologies, and increasing the production yield rate a few fractions of a percentage more was, and continues to be, thrilling. I get to puzzle for work, and I’ve got a whole team of like minded folks that makes another twenty years of SparkFun sound absolutely delightful.

## RISC-V Summit 2022: All Your CPUs Belong to Us

[![RISC-V Summit 2022: All Your CPUs Belong to Us](../assets/20230110/20230110rv.jpg)](https://www.eetimes.com/risc-v-summit-2022-all-your-cpus-belong-to-us/)

In [a recent guest editorial](https://www.eetimes.com/examining-the-top-five-fallacies-about-risc-v/) on EE Times, legendary professor David Patterson wrote about busting the five myths around the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). At the recent [RISC-V Summit](https://riscv.org/event/risc-v-summit-2022/) organized by RISC-V International, the consortium that manages and promotes the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), its president, Calista Redmond, had a far more blunt message: RISC-V is inevitable.

In fact, she said, RISC-V will eventually have the best CPUs, the best software running on them and the best ecosystem of any microprocessor core family. These are mighty strong words for a nascent ISA that is only about 10 years old and that competes with the far more established Arm and x86 ISAs. It almost sounded like the Borg from Star Trek when they say, “Resistance is futile.”

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230110/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Scott and Jeff and I had an 8.0.0 issue triage meeting and distributed the remaining issues among ourselves. As of this writing there are eight open issues.

We have had various issues with I2C on the ESP32-S3. There is a new proposed fix for the ESP-IDF. I tried it, but sadly it still doesn’t fix the behavior of the LC709203F or BNO055 I2C sensors. It's still necessary to retry operations to get them to work reliably, which is not necessary when they are used with an ESP32-S2.

**Melissa**

Recently I switched over to working on an installer for CircuitPython that could be used to directly program ESP32 boards instead of just downloading the firmware and using another tool to flash the board.

**Tim**

I've been working on the midi sequencer capabilities a little bit more, and starting to ramp back up on PR reviews after holiday break.

**Jeff**

I'm back to working on CircuitPython bugs! One interesting problem, discovered by a communuty member, was that multiple CircuitPython devices would not mount on the same MacOS machine at the same time. I learned that FAT devices have a 32-bit "Volume ID". MacOS apparently depends on the Volume ID being unique among devices inserted into the computer, but actually a fresh CircuitPython device would almost always get the same Volume ID. I corrected CircuitPython so that it chooses a random 32-bit volume ID when the CIRCUITPY drive is formatted (or, failing that, a volume ID that is based on the microcontroller's own unique ID).

**Scott**

This week I'm back from holiday vacation (even though I'm still visiting family.) I've gotten caught up on emails, Discord and forums. We've also had good discussions around 2023 planning. Next on my list is to draft my thoughts for #CircuitPython2023. I'd love to [hear your thoughts for #CircuitPython2023 too](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/)!
