Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The New Year brings new product announcements from Espressif and Raspberry Pi. And promised Raspberry Pi Pico W Bluetooth support. If you have a resolution to learn Python (or learn more Python), there are lots of free resources and classes available. And if you want to write Python on Linux, snag a free virtual machine from IBM. Now is the best time to get involved, with so many resources available. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Bluetooth Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W Likely Coming in January

[![Bluetooth Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20230110/20230110bt.jpg)](https://twitter.com/aallan/status/1610616300597907456?s=12&t=erdRbaVRnvVnCpDBWD34KA)

Bluetooth Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W is likely coming this month, per a Raspberry Pi team member. It will be in the 1.5.0 release of the Pico C software developer's kit. This should allow for adoption in Python at some point after that - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aallan/status/1610616300597907456?s=12&t=erdRbaVRnvVnCpDBWD34KA), [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/04/raspberry-pi-pico-w-picow-bluetooth-support-coming-this-month-raspberrypi-aallan-raspberry_pi/) and [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-bluetooth-support-is-just-around-the-corner-for-both-c-c-and-micropython-592c42d1170a).

## Raspberry Pi Releases New Autofocus Camera Modules

[![New Autofocus Camera Modules](../assets/20230110/20230110cam.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/)

Raspberry Pi announced Monday the launch of Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. Four different variants of Camera Module 3, in fact, starting at the familiar price of $25. There are new Camera Modules with both visible-light and infrared-sensitive options, and with either a standard or wide field of view (FoV). And in place of the fixed-focus optics of its predecessors, Camera Module 3 provides powered autofocus — which many have requested — allowing you to take crisp images of objects from around 5cm out to infinity - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/).

There is also a new video out discussing the cameras by Kevin McAleer - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/J_CkQ36tVA4).

## CircuitPython in 2023: Let the Devs Know Your Feelings!

[![CircuitPython in 2023](../assets/20230110/20230110cp23.jpg)](url)

As the year starts, the CircuitPython development team would like to take some time to share their goals for CircuitPython in 2023 and beyond. Just like past years (full summary [2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/), and [2022](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/01/thank-you-for-circuitpython2022/)), they’d like everyone in the Python on hardware community to contribute by posting their thoughts to a public place on the internet by Wednesday January 18th, 2023.

Here are a few ways to post:

* a video on YouTube
* a post on the CircuitPython forum
* a blog post on your site
* a post on Mastodon with tags #CircuitPython and #CircuitPython2023
* a Gist on GitHub

They want to hear from you. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2023 and email circuitpython2023@adafruit.com to let them know about your post so they can post it on the Adafruit Blog.

The post can cover any topic related to CircuitPython. See a suggested list and more in the post on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/). This includes any suggestions or comments related to this newsletter.

## SparkFun turns Twenty Years Old

[![SparkFun turns Twenty](../assets/20230110/20230110sf.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/5586)

SparkFun, an open source parts supplier, turned 20 yeard old last week, according to founder Nathan Seidle - [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/5586) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/YQ21ZxW6aoo).

> SparkFun turns 20 years old this week, and next year I’ll have worked at SparkFun half of my life. Since SparkFun opened its doors, there was always work to do. The challenge of getting a little faster to market, writing a little cleaner code, open sourcing more technologies, and increasing the production yield rate a few fractions of a percentage more was, and continues to be, thrilling. I get to puzzle for work, and I’ve got a whole team of like minded folks that makes another twenty years of SparkFun sound absolutely delightful.

## New Espressif Chip Announcements

Two announcements last Friday from Espressif on upcoming chips:

[![New Espressif Chip Announcements](../assets/20230110/20230110esp1.jpg)](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C6_Available)

Espressif’s Wi-Fi 6 SoC, ESP32-C6, is officially available and will be supported in ESP-IDF 5.1. It combines 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5 (LE) and the 802.15.4 protocol support. ESP32-C6 consists of a high-performance 32-bit RISC-V processor which can be clocked up to 160 MHz, and a low-power 32-bit RISC-V processor which can be clocked up to 20 MHz. ESP32-C6 has a 320KB ROM, a 512KB SRAM, and works with external flash. It comes with 30 (QFN40) or 22 (QFN32) programmable GPIOs, with support for SPI, UART, I2C, I2S, RMT, TWAI, PWM, SDIO, Motor Control PWM. It also packs a 12-bit ADC and a temperature sensor - [Espressif News](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C6_Available).

[![New Espressif Chip Announcements](../assets/20230110/20230110esp2.jpg)](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-P4)

The ESP32-P4 is powered by a dual-core RISC-V CPU with an AI instructions extension, an advanced memory subsystem, and integrated high-speed peripherals, running up to 400MHz. ESP32-P4 is designed for high-performance applications that require strong security. The ESP32-P4 HP core system has 768KB of on-chip SRAM, which can become accessible as cache when external PSRAM is available. In addition, the ESP32-P4 HP core system has 8KB of zero-wait TCM RAM, which can be used for fast data buffers or time-critical sections of code.

ESP32-P4 has more than 50 programmable GPIOs, which is significantly more than those of any other Espressif SoC to date. ESP32-P4 supports all the commonly used peripherals, such as SPI, I2S, I2C, LED PWM, MCPWM, RMT, ADC, DAC, UART, and TWAITM.

## RISC-V Summit 2022: All Your CPUs Belong to Us

[![RISC-V Summit 2022: All Your CPUs Belong to Us](../assets/20230110/20230110rv.jpg)](https://www.eetimes.com/risc-v-summit-2022-all-your-cpus-belong-to-us/)

In [a recent guest editorial](https://www.eetimes.com/examining-the-top-five-fallacies-about-risc-v/) on EE Times, legendary professor David Patterson wrote about busting the five myths around the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). At the recent [RISC-V Summit](https://riscv.org/event/risc-v-summit-2022/) organized by RISC-V International, the consortium that manages and promotes the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), its president, Calista Redmond, had a far more blunt message: RISC-V is inevitable.

In fact, she said, RISC-V will eventually have the best CPUs, the best software running on them and the best ecosystem of any microprocessor core family. These are mighty strong words for a nascent ISA that is only about 10 years old and that competes with the far more established Arm and x86 ISAs. It almost sounded like the Borg from Star Trek when they say, “Resistance is futile.”

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Scott and Jeff and I had an 8.0.0 issue triage meeting and distributed the remaining issues among ourselves. As of this writing there are eight open issues.

We have had various issues with I2C on the ESP32-S3. There is a new proposed fix for the ESP-IDF. I tried it, but sadly it still doesn’t fix the behavior of the LC709203F or BNO055 I2C sensors. It's still necessary to retry operations to get them to work reliably, which is not necessary when they are used with an ESP32-S2.

**Melissa**

Recently I switched over to working on an installer for CircuitPython that could be used to directly program ESP32 boards instead of just downloading the firmware and using another tool to flash the board.

**Tim**

I've been working on the midi sequencer capabilities a little bit more, and starting to ramp back up on PR reviews after holiday break.

**Jeff**

I'm back to working on CircuitPython bugs! One interesting problem, discovered by a communuty member, was that multiple CircuitPython devices would not mount on the same MacOS machine at the same time. I learned that FAT devices have a 32-bit "Volume ID". MacOS apparently depends on the Volume ID being unique among devices inserted into the computer, but actually a fresh CircuitPython device would almost always get the same Volume ID. I corrected CircuitPython so that it chooses a random 32-bit volume ID when the CIRCUITPY drive is formatted (or, failing that, a volume ID that is based on the microcontroller's own unique ID).

**Scott**

This week I'm back from holiday vacation (even though I'm still visiting family.) I've gotten caught up on emails, Discord and forums. We've also had good discussions around 2023 planning. Next on my list is to draft my thoughts for #CircuitPython2023. I'd love to [hear your thoughts for #CircuitPython2023 too](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/)!
