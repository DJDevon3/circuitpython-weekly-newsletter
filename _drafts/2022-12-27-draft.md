## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221227/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.6 on Wednesday 12/21. This release includes the change from .env to settings.toml, and a rework of the coprocessor API, more specialized for the Espressif ULP (ultra low power) RISC-V coprocessor.

I fixed several miscellaneous problems for this release, including a crash only when running debug builds on Cortex-M4. That turned out to be an obscure compiler-related issue: tracking it down involved looking at the generated assembly code. I discovered I had fixed more or less the same problem five years ago (!), but it reappeared.

We now have only five or six remaining issues to resolve for CircuitPython 8.0.0 final. I'm looking forward to seeing 8.0.0 in general release.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Scrolling Countdown Timer](https://learn.adafruit.com/scrolling-countdown-timer) guide. This was a collaboration with [Liz](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/BlitzCityDIY) and [Noe](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/pixil3d). It walks you through building a scrolling event countdown timer using three quad alphanumeric backpacks with displays, a QT Py ESP32-S2, and a 3D printed stand. The guide focusses on the countdown to Christmas, but you can easily edit the code to countdown to anything! Check it out!

As 2022 comes to an end, I want to say thank you to everyone in our community, to the folks who read my guides, and to all who contribute to the CircuitPython project in all ways, big and small. Code + Community = CircuitPython. Without our community, CircuitPython wouldn't be close to what it is. I greatly appreciate all of you. Have a wonderful holiday or time off, and a wonderful start to 2023!

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on adding some finishing touches to [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org/). Due to the holidays, the changes likely won't be merged in until the beginning of next year because the person I would like to take a look is taking time off. In the mean time, I plan to turn my focus to the main [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) website.

I've been on a lighter schedule for the holidays, but I did update the NeXT keyboard guide to add support for the NeXT mouse, which can be daisy chained through the keyboard. Check out the updated guide.

This week I worked on the [NeoPixel Sprite Weather Display project](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-sprite-weather-display). It uses a QT Py ESP32-S2 with a 5x5 NeoPixel Grid BFF to display weather sprites and scroll text to display the current temperature. It uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en) to grab weather data. I wanted to do a project with this API since it is open-source and doesn't require an API key.

I will be out for the next two weeks to recharge for the new year. I'm looking forward to working on and sharing more awesome projects in 2023!
