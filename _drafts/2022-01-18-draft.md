## CircuitPython 7.1.1 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.1.1 Released](../assets/20220118/20220118cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/14/circuitpython-7-1-1-released/)

CircuitPython 7.1.1, the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, is the current stable release. It has fixes for RGBMatrix on RP2040 and PDMIn (microphone input) on SAMx boards, such as Circuit Playground Express. There are no other changes; unless you are affected by these problems, you do not need to upgrade from 7.1.0. - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/14/circuitpython-7-1-1-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

## Reading Floppy Disks in CircuitPython

[![Reading Floppy Disks in CircuitPython](../assets/20220118/20220118floppy.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/11/native-floppy-disk-support-coming-soon-to-circuitpython/)

jepler just created a build of CircuitPython with the new native ‘adafruit_floppy’ module which implements MFM decoding ‘on the fly’ to provide Python-native filesystem support for floppy drives! You can now store files and code that is read or executed off of a floppy disk. Adafruit whipped up a quick demo that lists the files on a disk and pages through any textfiles it finds on these FAT12 disks. Arduino libraries and more CircuitPython capability are being worked on at the moment - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/11/native-floppy-disk-support-coming-soon-to-circuitpython/), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bomzzq6j4fA) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1481116109277483015).

In related work, Adafruit also demonstrates using TinyUSB and Arduino to make a USB mass storage floppy drive on Windows. Most of us have not seen a Drive A: on their computers in many years - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/14/using-tinyusb-and-arduino-to-make-a-usb-mass-storage-floppy-%f0%9f%92%be-drive/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rPW6axdsajg).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220118/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **344**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I fixed a longstanding problem with `audiobusio.PDMIn`, which reads data from PDM digital microphones, such as the one on the Circuit Playground Express. I'm now working on a deep-sleep power consumption issue with ESP32-S2.

Either or both of these deserve a CircuitPython 7.1.1 release, so I'll do so after we figure out what should be in it.

**Jeff**

Great success with floppies! With my work in progress branch, I've been able to mount 1.44MB (3.5") and 1.2MB (5.25") floppies and access the files inside from CircuitPython! Next up, I'll make the code usable from both CircuitPython and Arduino and then make a pull request to add it to CircuitPython.

If you want to ask me anything about the MFM floppy encoding, do it now, because in a week or so from now the knowledge will vanish from my working memory, safely sealed away in Adafruit_Floppy.

You can watch a demo of the code in action from a segment on last week's [Ask an Engineer](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/13/the-python-on-hardware-weekly-video-january-12-2022-circuitpython-python-floppy-adafruit/).

**Kattni**

This week I published the basics of the [Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s2-tft-feather) guide. We wanted to get something live so folks who picked up this board had a place to get started. Keep an eye on the guide for the rest of the content, coming soon!

I also updated the Factory Reset page for the ESP32-S2 to have all the info needed for a factory reset or a bootloader repair, and updated the Install the UF2 Bootloader page to point to that so all the information is in one place. The process is identical, so we ran into having two pages with the same lengthy info on them. Not anymore!

Next up is finishing up the rest of the content for the QT Py ESP32-S2 guide, followed by the content for the TFT Feather guide. It involves a bit of bouncing around, but I'm working to get everything good to go!

**Scott**

Last week I wrapped up my Raspberry Pi work for a while. I wrote [a Learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi-bare-metal-no-os) to get folks going using it. I also merged in support for the original Zero and Zero W (not supporting WiFi.)

After wrapping this up, I started working on the ESP32-S3 in CircuitPython. I've started by reworking the sdkconfig generation to support different target platforms. After wrapping that up, I'll be debugging the problems with WiFi on the S3.

Lastly, I'll be finishing my #CircuitPython2022 post so that I can cover it tomorrow in my second Deep Dive of the new year. In [the first Deep Dive I reviewed last year's #CircuitPython2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Owgls-SA8).
