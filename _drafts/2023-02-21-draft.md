## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230221/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.2 on Tuesday, February 14. This has some minor but necessary fixes to 8.0.0. There is no 8.0.1 -- I labeled the wrong thing with 8.0.1, so I just discarded it.

I added safemode.py to CircuitPython over the past week. safemode.py allows you to run some code to decide what to do after entering safe mode. Now you can recover automatically, instead of forcing the user to push a reset button to exit safe mode. This feature will be in the first beta of 8.1.0, which will be released soon, and is already available to test in the "Absolute Newest" builds.

**Kattni**

This week the [ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT Feather guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s2-reverse-tft-feather) went live. It has everything you need to get started with and learn about your new Feather. 

I updated the [Feather ESP32-S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s3-feather) to reflect the new revision having a different battery monitor chip onboard. There's code for both of them, and instructions on how to tell the difference.

**Melissa**

This past week, I have been working hard on the CircuitPython Installer for [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/). It is just about done feature-wise, but I'm still working on some debugging. At the moment, it is hanging while attempting to flash the device. Since I'm sure the code to flash the device is working, being that it is in a separate module and in use in other areas, it's only a matter of figuring out why my code just isn't working. I expect to have it working very soon since it was working at one point.

**Tim**

This week I tested PRs for the Wiznet Ethernet library and some others in the MiniMQTT library including new functionality to use secure communication on different ports rather than only the default one. I wired up a 7 color eink display and attempted to try out a PR build that adds support for displayio with it, I've been unsuccessful so far but will keep at it and have gotten a point in the right direction from Scott.

**Jeff**

**Scott**

This week I wrapped up my dedicated work on [pysigrok](https://github.com/pysigrok/pysigrok). It's early but usable. In fact, I've started writing an "Implementer's Guide to the CircuitPython API" and am using it for testing. The goal of this guide is to assist folks in implementing the various modules that make up the CircuitPython API. I'm working to test and fix the iMX RT APIs and documenting gotchas as a I run across them.

**Liz**

This week I wrote guides on two new products: the [microSD Card BFF](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microsd-card-bff) and the [NeoKey BFF](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neokey-bff). The BFF boards are able to attach to the back of the QT Py boards, making them good for tiny projects. I think that the microSD Card BFF would be great for a tiny datalogger and the NeoKey BFF would be great for a tiny macro, like a commonly used keyboard shortcut or a password holder.
