## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230307/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.1.0-beta.0 on Tuesday, February, our first beta for 8.1.0. The release includes support for **safemode.py**, which I documented in a new Learn Guide: [CircuitPython Safe Mode](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-safe-mode).

I'm continuing to look at new and old issues for the 8.x.x releases of CircuitPython.

**Melissa**

This past week, I wrote a library to be able to merge binary files at different offsets for use in flashing with esptool. This allows for [the WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader](https://adafruit.github.io/WipperSnapper_Firmware_Uploader/) to be able to generate downloadable images for flashing later in case users have trouble using the built-in flashing tool.

The CircuitPython Installer I have been working for quite a while was merged in as well. This tool requires a Chrome browser. This is a tool for [ESP32-based boards on circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads?mcufamilies=esp32s3&mcufamilies=esp32s2&mcufamilies=esp32c3&mcufamilies=esp32) A few follow-up bug fixes were needed, but the tool is ready for testing. It allows for easily flashing CircuitPython and boot loaders using Web Serial and the File System Access APIs right from the circuitpython.org website. This is especially useful for ESP32 boards because there is no native USB and thus no CIRCUITPY drive. For boards without a CIRCUITPY drive, normally the WIFI settings need to be configured via the REPL, however the installer handles all of this for you.

**Tim**

I worked on some additional examples and fixes in two new 7 color eink libraries. I tested some proposed fixes for UART usage of the PN532 NFC card reader. Lastly I've begun updating example code for the displayio API changes that the now stable 8.0.0 brought.

**Jeff**

I published a guide for the Floppy FeatherWing. It includes a CircuitPython example for reading raw flux from a floppy disk.

I have a guide in the works using CircuitPython to adapt the SNES "Mario Paint" mouse to a modern PC using CircuitPython—watch the New Guides section to find out when that's released.

**Scott**

**Liz**

This week I worked on some product guides. I updated the [I2C/SPI LCD Backpack guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-spi-lcd-backpack) for the new STEMMA QT version. I also updated the [ATtiny Breakouts guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-attiny817-seesaw) for the new ATtiny816 and ATtiny1616 versions in the shop. I added a page on how to reprogram the boards with a UPDI programmer, which I think will be helpful for folks.

I have also been making slow but steady progress on the robot lyre project. The CAD design has proven to be very challenging, but I think I've finally gotten it. [I posted up a demo](https://mastodon.social/@blitzcitydiy/109951007615302014) plucking one note repeatedly and hopefully I can get a full demo setup and running in the next week.
