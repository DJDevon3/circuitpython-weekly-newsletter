Damien George's talk "Open-Source Communities and Ten Years of MicroPython" at PyCon AU 2023 is now available online, with very interesting insights into the language and community - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEQQWpjgFd8).

## Python in Excel: Microsoft Combines the Power of Python and the Flexibility of Excel

[![Python in Excel](../assets/20230828/20230828pe.jpg)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439)

Microsoft has announced an evolution in the analytical capabilities available within Excel by releasing a Public Preview of Python in Excel. Python in Excel makes it possible to natively combine Python and Excel analytics within the same workbook - with no setup required. With Python in Excel, you can type Python directly into a cell, the Python calculations run in the Microsoft Cloud, and results are returned to the worksheet, including plots and visualizations - [Microsoft Excel Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439).

Python creator Guido van Rossum states he helped the Excel team with this initiative - [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1694031794306458056?t=AsdfrW3a1trrNsz_J9yd8g&s=03).

## Over-the-Air Software Updating for MicroPython

[![Over-the-Air Software Updating for MicroPython](../assets/20230828/20230828ota.jpg)](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/micropython-ota.html)

If you’ve ever had a software update pop up on your smartphone or smart TV, you’ve encountered an OTA update, even if you didn’t know it by name. OTA, or Over-The-Air, refers to the method of transmitting data across a network without any wired connection. Kevin McAleer has created a simple OTA module for MicroPython  so you can now add OTA to your own projects - [Kev's Robots](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/micropython-ota.html), [GitHub](https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/ota) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/f1widOJYQDc).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
