Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! And the Python community roars to life again! This week we have a number of features as folks return from their summer vacations. This included some new news on CircuitPython 8 and 9, Damien's talk on MicroPython, and Microsoft's announcement of Python in Excel. - * Anne Barela, Editor.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Open-Source Communities and Ten Years of MicroPython - Damien George (PyCon AU 2023)

Damien George's talk "Open-Source Communities and Ten Years of MicroPython" at PyCon AU 2023 is now available online, with very interesting insights into the language and community - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEQQWpjgFd8).

## Python in Excel: Microsoft Combines the Power of Python and the Flexibility of Excel

[![Python in Excel](../assets/20230828/20230828pe.jpg)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439)

Microsoft has announced new analytical capabilities available within Excel with the release of a Public Preview of Python in Excel. Python in Excel makes it possible to natively combine Python and Excel analytics within the same workbook - with no setup required. With Python in Excel, you can type Python directly into a cell, the Python calculations run in the Microsoft Cloud, and results are returned to the worksheet, including plots and visualizations - [Microsoft Excel Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841167/microsoft-excel-python-integration-support).

Python creator Guido van Rossum states he helped the Excel team with this initiative - [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1694031794306458056?t=AsdfrW3a1trrNsz_J9yd8g&s=03).

CircuitPython 8.2.4 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, and is a new stable release. It now appears that minor changes will be going into the 8.x branch as version 9.0 is expected to take some time, as significant changes and updates from MicroPython are being incorporated - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/08/22/circuitpython-8-2-4-released/).

**Notable changes to 8.2.4 since 8.2.3**

* New and fixed boards.
* Improved messages and documentation.

## Over-the-Air Software Updating for MicroPython

[![Over-the-Air Software Updating for MicroPython](../assets/20230828/20230828ota.jpg)](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/micropython-ota.html)

If you’ve ever had a software update pop up on your smartphone or smart TV, you’ve encountered an OTA update, even if you didn’t know it by name. OTA, or Over-The-Air, refers to the method of transmitting data across a network without any wired connection. Kevin McAleer has created a simple OTA module for MicroPython  so you can now add OTA to your own projects - [Kev's Robots](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/micropython-ota.html), [GitHub](https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/ota) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/f1widOJYQDc).

## What to do when CircuitPython 8.2.0 or later cannot be installed properly on a board with an nRF52840

[![What to do when CircuitPython 8.2.0 or later cannot be installed properly on a board with nRF52840](../assets/20230828/20230828nrf.jpg)](https://steam-tokyo.com/nrf52840-circuitpython-8-2/)

Starting with CircuitPython 8.2.0, UF2 bootloader version 0.4.1 or higher is required for microcontroller boards with a nRF52840. For nRF52840 boards with older UF2 bootloaders, CircuitPython 8.2.0 and above cannot be successfully installed. This guide explains the precautions and the procedure for updating the UF2 bootloader - [Styram Tokyo](https://steam-tokyo.com/nrf52840-circuitpython-8-2/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added, but several are in development!

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Jeff and I finished the MicroPython v1.19.1 merge into CircuitPython early last week. The next step is to merge MicroPython v1.20. v1.21 might be coming out relatively soon, and so we might include that when it's ready, or when significant parts are ready.

MicroPython v1.21 will include the removal of the "u" prefix on most of MicroPython's modules that correspond to CPython modules. For instance, MicroPython's `utime` will become `time`. We made this change in CircuitPython a long time ago, but there were still remnants of the "u" prefix in the code base. I finished removing most of these traces in advance of v1.21. That solved some remaining issues we were seeing with running the test suite, and will reduce the merge differences when we get to v1.21.

**Kattni**

This week I've been working on the Metro ESP32-S3 guide. It will be live by the time this newsletter is published. So if you picked up one of these boards, check out the guide.

CircuitPython Day was a complete success. Thank you to everyone who livestreamed content, and a special thank you to everyone who watched. The `synthio` panel went extremely well, and I even learned a few new things. Jeff, Dan and I chatted about CircuitPython features you may not know about but probably should, and answered questions from the folks watching. I had a lot of fun, and I hope everyone who participated did too!

**Melissa**

**Tim**

This week I streamed work on a CircuitPython implementation of Chip's Challenge on CircuitPython days and a few times over the following weekend. Working on the game has also initiated some re-writing and improvements to the Tiled map library that I wrote in order to load maps exported by Tiled into `dispalyio` `TileGrid` objects for drawing on a display. The other main item on my plate for the week was submitting OSHWA requests for the remaining products that weren't in their system yet. These are caught up and I'll be getting back into more Library work next week.

**Jeff**

As Dan mentioned, together we finished merging MicroPython 1.19.1. This version of MicroPython doesn't bring any big headline features, but it's a good way to keep up with bug fixes from upstream.

Right now there's no pre-built bundle for the "main" branch build of CircuitPython. This is because the merge of 1.19 made the mpy library module format incompatible with CircuitPython 8.x, but we know that 1.20 will create another incompatibility. Once we believe we're past any incompatible mpy file format changes, we'll update the bundle.

This means that when installing libraries, you will need to use the "py" format and not the "mpy" format; if you use cirucup to install libraries, you can use pass the `--py` flag, for example: `circup install --py nepixel`.

**Scott**

I'm just back from vacation. I believe I was working on USB host testing and the ESP-IDF 5.0 merge before I left. The rest of this week will be catch up and starting to get back into it.

**Liz**

This past week I worked on documenting using [Docker to compile Linux for an ESP32-S3](https://learn.adafruit.com/docker-esp32-s3-linux). Ladyada had been working on this during some of her [livestreams](https://youtu.be/f6ZhVPpiNzM) and created a Docker file to compile the Linux kernel. I learned a lot working on this. I'm also excited to try creating Docker files for other processes that can sometimes be tricky using WSL on Windows.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever!

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20230828/20230828weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
