## CircuitPython 7.0.0 Release Candidate 1

[![CircuitPython 7.0.0 Release Candidate 1](../assets/20210907/20210907cp7.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

CircuitPython 7.0.0-rc1, is now available. Release candidate builds mark the final testing of CircuitPython 7 for stable release. It contains only a few issues still to be addressed for 7.0.0. The Python API’s it presents are not expected to change compatibility before the final 7.0.0 release, though they may be augmented.

Notable additions to 7.0.0 since 6.3.0 include:

* Support for the CircuitPython development workflow over BLE.
* Camera support on ESP32-S2.
* `qrio`: QR code decoding.
* The keypad key-scanning module.
* Run-time customization of USB devices.
* Merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.16.
* `_pixelbuf` is now `adafruit_pixelbuf`.
* `colorwheel()` routine moved to `rainbowio`.
* `supervisor.ticks_ms()` to allow easier time-keeping.
* Simplifications to the RGB status LED codes.
* A clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards.
* Rework of `vectorio` and some of its API. `VectorShape` is no longer needed for user code.
* `atexit` module.
* `getpass` module.
* `traceback` module.
* `supervisor.get_previous_traceback()`.
* board.LED now consistently present on all boards that have such an LED.
* `PulseOut` no longer needs a `PWMOut`.
* Unicode filename support.
* Board ID is now in boot_out.txt and available as board.board_id.
* `aesio` on for full builds by default.

## MicroPython 1.17 Released

[![MicroPython 1.17 Released](../assets/20210907/20210907mp.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.17)

The 1.17 release of MicroPython adds support for f-strings (PEP-498), with a few limitations compared to normal Python. F-strings are essentially syntactic sugar for "".format() and make formatting strings a lot more convenient. Other improvements to the core runtime include pretty printing OSError when it has two arguments (an errno code and a string), scheduling of KeyboardInterrupt on the main thread, and support for a single argument to the optimised form of StopIteration.

In the machine module a new I2S class has been added, with support for esp32 and stm32 ports. This provides a consistent API for transmit and receive of audio data in blocking, non-blocking and asyncio-based operation. Also, the json module has support for the "separators" argument in the dump and dumps functions, and framebuf now includes a way to blit between frame buffers of different formats using a palette. A new, portable machine.bitstream function is also added which can output a stream of bits with configurable timing, and is used as the basis for driving WS2812 LEDs in a common way across ports.

There has been some restructuring of the repository directory layout, with all third-party code now in the lib/ directory. And a new top-level directory shared/ has been added with first-party code that was previously in lib/ moved there.

The docs have seen further improvement with enhancements and additions to the rp2 parts, as well as a new quick reference for the zephyr port. The terms master/slave have been replaced with controller/peripheral, mainly relating to I2C and SPI usage. And u-module references have been replaced with just the module name without the u-prefix to help clear up the intended usage of modules in MicroPython.

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210907/20210907bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210907/20210907pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210907/20210907pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210907/20210907pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).
