## 500 Adafruit Projects Have Been Certified as Open Source by OSHWA

[![500 Adafruit Projects](../assets/20220215/20220215oshwa.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/07/500-adafruit-projects-have-been-certified-as-open-source-by-oshwa/)

Adafruit is an Open Source Hardware and Software company. To that end, Adafruit has been working to submit many of their boards for certification by the Open Source Hardware Association. According to OSHWA:

> The certification program exists to make it easy for creators and users to identify hardware that follows the community definition of open source hardware maintained by OSHWA. Hardware projects that display the certification logo are licensed and documented in a way that makes it easy for users to use and build upon them.

On February 7th, Adafruit hit the milestone of 500 certified projects and was the first to reach this number. By registering their boards with OSHWA, Adafruit aims to ensure users that the products they sell are open-source, and easy to learn about.

Adafruit extends a special thank you to everyone who made this possible, but especially the wonderful folks over at OSHWA who set all this up and were incredibly helpful throughout this process. Additionally, they thank the community that keeps this all going and encourages them to publish, share, and more! - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/07/500-adafruit-projects-have-been-certified-as-open-source-by-oshwa/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220215/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **344**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_HTTPServer](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HTTPServer)

**Updated Libraries!**

This week's updated libraries are too many to list!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am continuing to look at asyncio support for HTTP clients (and potentially servers). I have looked at several async HTTP client libraries. Most have quite similar API's. I am leaning toward writing a simple one that does not mimic one of these exactly, but is still very similar.

For another small project, mentioned last week, I wrote a [simple HTTP server library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HTTPServer) that runs on CircuitPython and also on CPython.

I released CircuitPython 7.2.0-alpha.2, which has nearly two months of changes.

**Jeff**

I continued work on floppy disks, but now I'm truly getting close to wrapping things up. I'll take a little breather before bringing the latest changes into CircuitPython. What I spent the last week working on was using the RP2040's PIO peripheral to accurately capture & generate the flux waveforms that define how data is stored on floppies. Using CircuitPython it was very easy to test & refine the portion of the software that runs on the PIO mini-CPUs inside the RP2040; much harder, by contrast, was making it all work within the Arduino environment.

**Kattni**

This week I updated the 0.56" LED backpack [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/overview) with the new STEMMA QT rev, as well as the MCP4725 [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/mcp4725-12-bit-dac-tutorial) for the same. I'm now working on the guide for the ADXL375, a new accelerometer we added to the shop recently. It needed a CircuitPython library which I wrote up and will use in the guide. Keep an eye out for that!

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20220215/20220215melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I finally worked the last of the bugs out of the LittleFS port. This was packaged up as part of the WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader, which will generate a LittleFS image with a secrets.json file on it and flash the image right onto either an ESP32 or ESP8266. Currently WipperSnapper isn't live for the ESP8266, so other than flashing everything onto it, you can't currently do anything with it, but soon many Feather Huzzah ESP8266 boards will be able to easily be flashed with and configured without needing to write a single line of code.

**Tim**

I have been working on going through all of the open library PRs to review and test them or ping authors as needed. A cool one from this week was a new motion sensing feature for the VC0706 camera device. I had not ever used cameras with CircuitPython before so it was neat to get it set up and learn how to snap photos from it. The motion sensing could be useful as a primitave security camera type setup, only saving photos when motion is sensed in order to maximize the available storage space. 

This week I also wrapped up the code for the PyPortal Winamp player project and have started writing the guide pages for it. Part of that process was generalizing a ScrollingLabel widget that I initially coded for this project and getting it prepared to share in the Display Text library. The new version was recently published with this new displayio [ScrollingLabel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Display_Text/blob/main/adafruit_display_text/scrolling_label.py) widget. The Winamp player project will use it, but it can now also be used by anyone else for other projects as well.

**Scott**

This week I've been working to wrap up BLE GATT client support on the ESP32-S3. As I said last week, I've been somewhat stuck on this, so I'm going to wrap up my pending work and then dig into USB Host support in CircuitPython on the RP2040. [sekigon-gonnoc on GitHub](https://github.com/sekigon-gonnoc/Pico-PIO-USB) has figured out how to use PIO for USB Host which could make the RP2040 a neat USB bridge device. 

I've wanted to start learning USB host to add support to the broadcom port at some point too. This will be a chance to learn it in a simpler system.
