## There are now over 400 CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards

[![There are now over 400 CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards](../assets/20230516/20230516-400.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/05/12/there-are-now-over-400-circuitpython-compatible-microcontroller-boards-circuitpython-python-adafruit/)

There are now over 400 CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards with a large addition this past week. They include boards from many manufacturers - these are boards from the community, companies that are not Adafruit, and entire new businesses / makers using and shipping boards with CircuitPython. Supported chips include: Espressif, Microchip SAMD, Nordic, NXP, RP2040, ST, iMX RT and more! - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/05/12/there-are-now-over-400-circuitpython-compatible-microcontroller-boards-circuitpython-python-adafruit/) and [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

The growth of CircuitPython compatible boards since 2017. It's interesting that it's been less than a year since 300 which is about two boards per week which is fabulous growth.

## FreakWAN: a LoRa-based open WAN network

[![FreakWAN: a LoRa-based open WAN network](../assets/20230516/20230516freak.jpg)](https://github.com/antirez/freakwan)

FreakWAN is an effort to create a LoRa-based open WAN network, completely independent from Internet and the cellular phones networks. It is coded in MicroPython with a SX1276 LoRa chip driver. It is possible to send encrypted messages that will reach only other users with a matching symmetric key. FreakWAN also implements its own very small, losslessy compressed 1 bit images, as a proof of concept that can send small media types over LoRa - [GitHub](https://github.com/antirez/freakwan) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wvdsteen/status/1656288304885530625) and [Y Combinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35882967).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230516/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **438**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I was away from work for a week, and am now back, fixing more things in preparation for the CircuitPython 8.1.0 release.

**Kattni**

This week, I finished up the code for the Canary Nightlight project. The main functionality is that it will either shine blue or red, depending on the time range that you configure. Most folks should be doing red at night and blue in the morning, but if you do shift work and/or need to wake up at vastly different times, you can configure it so it works for you as well. It also includes a feature to notify you when your internet is down by blinking red. As you might not want this happening in certain situations, you can easily disable this feature at the beginning of the code. This is intended for a collab guide with Noe. Noe designed an amazing 3D printed canary especially for this project! Guide is coming soon.

Other than that, I'm up to a miscellaneous list of guide updates. Making sure the misc is getting done too!

**Melissa**

This past week I added a bunch of boards to [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/). There were about 12 new CircuitPython boards added putting us at over 400 and about 19 new Blinka boards putting us at 120 boards.

**Tim**

I've been working on reviewing PRs submitted by PyCon sprinters. Going back through ones that people have followed up on after initial round of feedback. I also submitted two small fixes in the core: one an argument validation bug that could cause a hard fault if wrong types were passed to `vectorio` `Polygon`, and one to add some additional Python built-in methods to the `displayio.Group` stubs so that mypy and other code analysis tools will know its capabilities.

**Jeff**

My work was on `synthio` again this week. In the next pull request, I generalized Note 'vibrato' so the same code could do triple duty as a pitch bend or frequency sweep as well, enabled stereo output, with the Note `panning` property controlling whether it appears on the left channel, right channel, or both, and implemented 'ring modulation' which is useful for creating richer, more dynamic sounds.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on CircuitPyrate, a CircuitPython version of Bus Pirate. (We'll likely rename it before releasing the code because CircuitPyrate and CircuitPython are *very* similar.) I've also created a CircuitPython version of the [`prompt_toolkit`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Prompt_Toolkit) library for managing the command history.

I've also been working on an e-paper weather display using the Pirate Weather API. Pirate Weather implements the Dark Sky API and the JSON responses are ~30k or so. I couldn't parse it all into memory on the Pico W so I created a [CircuitPython version of the `json_stream` library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_JSON_Stream/). This allows you to work with the returned object just like the `json` module with the huge exception that you must access data in file order. The library gets the data from the stream as you ask for it and can't go backwards. This makes it use less total memory but restricts how you get the data.

**Liz**

I published two new product guides this week. The first was for the [Feather RP2040 ThinkInk](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-feather-thinkink). This Feather lets you plug in an eInk display directly to a connector on the back of the board. I also included a page on using it with the u2if firmware that lets you use desktop Python libraries with RP2040-based boards.

The second guide was for the [PiCowbell CAN Bus](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-picowbell-can-bus-for-pico). It lets you use a Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W to connect to CAN bus networks for automotive or robotics projects.
