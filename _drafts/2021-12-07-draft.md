## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-blinka)

## New Learn Guides!

[![New Learn Guides](../assets/20211207/20211207learn.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest)

There are no new Learn guides this week, but more are on the way. Check back next week!

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211207/20211207bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211207/20211207pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211207/20211207pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211207/20211207pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211207/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **341**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_VL6180X](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_VL6180X)
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout)
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_PortalBase](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PortalBase)
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_AVRprog](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AVRprog)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made the release for CircuitPython 7.0.0-beta.1 on 2021-11-29. This release has a number of fixes since beta.0, but we still have more bugs to fix, and I and the rest of the team are working on these. I'm also debugging some RP2040 I2C problems with our ATTiny-based seesaw boards.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20211207/20211207melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I worked on a new guide for a laser controlled with a Nunchuk and CircuitPython. This included 3D modeling a few parts to make project easier to assemble. Keep an eye out for this guide.

**Scott**

Last week was short due to Thanksgiving here in the US. I did get the Raspberry Pi builds on circuitpython.org. You can see them [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads?q=raspberry+pi). It includes limited I2C support. This week I'm working on supporting all I2C peripherals, proper pin in use checking and pin muxing. These will allow for SPI and UART support as well. I'll also be working on a Learn guide for CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi.
