## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230612/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.0-beta.1 on Thursday, June 8. Notably, it contains the latest round of `synthio` changes, and fixes an issue on the Circuit Playground Express that caused stack overflows.

I've started merging MicroPython v1.19.1 into CircuitPython. When that is working, we'll start on v1.20. There are also some interesting changes post-v1.20 that we might want to pick up soon.

**Kattni**

This week the [Feather RP2040 DVI guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-dvi) went live. It has everything you need to get started using your Feather DVI. If you picked up one of these nifty boards, check out the guide!

Next up is the NeoKey MX and CHOC Breakouts guide. It will have all the details about these little boards, including demos in CircuitPython and Arduino. Keep an eye out for this one!

**Melissa**

This past week I continued working on GitHub issues. My main focus was on testing a PR for CircuitPython and updating the MatrixPortal library for an upcoming new version of the MatrixPortal board.

**Tim**

I've been working on moving typing PR's forward that had been stalled since being submitted this week. In addition I've continued digging inside of the core `displayio` code to gain a better understanding of it's internals and ultimately try to fix an issue that causes hidden elements to take longer to render then their visible counterparts. 

**Jeff**

Last week I mentioned that I was working on a `synthio` enhancement. This work, per-note filtering based on the mathematical "biquad" filter, has been merged and is in 8.2.0-beta.1.

**Scott**

This week I've bounced from [adding 1-Wire](https://github.com/adafruit/Circuit_Pyrate/commit/0dec24053456b7c315ff0bc289ad2387bba6348a) and [UART to the Pyrate code](https://github.com/adafruit/Circuit_Pyrate/commit/eb0288c51fac0f394fcb5e88408b56b8d9981911), to [slimming down stack frames to allow more recursion in CP](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8071) and [writing a generator for the swirly mounting grid](https://gist.github.com/tannewt/0acd1f6af48c43dc7e15243fe0af47ed). I've also been [poking](https://github.com/tannewt/StemmaG0-Template) the [STM32G0 Stemma QT board](https://github.com/tannewt/StemmaG0) that I designed.

**Liz**

I had two new guides go live this week. The first is the [product guide for the NeoDriver](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neodriver-i2c-to-neopixel-driver), which is a seesaw-based breakout that lets you control NeoPixels over I2C. This is really handy for folks using Blinka on non-Raspberry Pi single board computers. I did some testing with some of these SBC's and had some great results. The most impressive were with Libre Computer's Le Potato board. I wrote up the steps required to get it running on [one of my user pages](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/BlitzCityDIY/pages/neodriver-with-le-potato).

The second guide was a big project: the [Circle of Fifths Euclidean Synth with synthio and CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/circle-of-fifths-euclidean-synth-with-synthio-and-circuitpython). This was a fun challenge to use the `synthio` module for the first time and come up with an intuitive and responsive musical interface using the ANO rotary encoders. I hope folks will find the guide useful for inspiring their own `synthio` projects.
