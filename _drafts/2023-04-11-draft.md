## The New Raspberry Pi Python Code Editor for Young People

[![Python Code Editor](../assets/20230411/20230411ed.jpg)]([url](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/code-editor-beta-testing/))

Raspberry Pi are building a new online text-based Code Editor to help young people aged 7 and older learn to write code. It’s free and designed for students who attend Code Clubs and CoderDojos, students in schools, and learners at home. The beta oftware allows one to **write and run Python code right in their browser, with no setup required**. The interface is simple and intuitive, which makes getting started with text-based coding easier. They can also save their code using their Raspberry Pi Foundation account. Raspberry Pi wants learners to easily build on projects they start in the classroom at home, or bring a project they’ve started at home to their coding club.

The editor is not limited to students - it can be used by anyone. While it is not VSCode, the all-browser implementation is very helpful. The effort to build language-specific editors is tremendous and Raspberry Pi should be given kudos for their progress - [Raspberry Pi]([url](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/code-editor-beta-testing/)).

## PyCon US Happening in April: CircuitPython-Related Activities

[![PyCon US 2023](../assets/20230411/pycon2023.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2023/)

[PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/) is coming up in Salt Lake City, Utah USA April 21 - 23 with Development Sprints April 24 - 27. Adafruit CircuitPython team members be there hosting events! Kattni Rembor and Jeff Epler will be present, along with a few well-known community members. 

Kattni and Jeff will be managing Open Spaces during the conference. The location and time is yet to be determined, but will be known when the conference begins. These Open Spaces will give folks an introduction to CircuitPython via the Circuit Playground Express. There will be a Quickstart worksheet available to get started easily, and Kattni & Jeff will there to help. Kattni will be bringing some fun extras as well. Everyone is welcome to attend!

Kattni will be hosting three days of Development Sprints from 8am-5pm on Monday April 24 through Wednesday April 26. Jeff will be joining on Monday. The location will be determined during the conference. The Sprints are an opportunity to contribute to the CircuitPython project, on the Python side of things, through code and documentation on CircuitPython Libraries. Everyone is welcome; there will still be all of the introduction to CircuitPython hardware, so there will be opportunities for folks at any level to participate.

Kattni states: "If you're attending, please let me know ahead of time in the `#circuitpython-dev` channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord), or come find us around the conference. We'd love to meet up! We're looking forward to PyCon 2023, and we hope you are too! See you there!" - [PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/).

## Programming Language Popularity by GitHub Pull Requests

[![Programming Language Popularity by GitHub Pull Requests](../assets/20230411/20230411gh.jpg)](https://lemire.me/blog/2023/04/07/programming-language-popularity-by-github-pull-requests/)

GitHub is probably the most popular software repository in the world. One important feature on GitHub is the ‘pull request’: we often contribute to a piece of software by proposing changes to a piece of code. The number of pull requests is not, per se, an objective measure of how much one contributes to a piece of software. Nevertheless, in the auithor's view, the number of pull requests is an important indicator of how much people are willing and capable of contributing to your software in the open source domain - [Daniel Lemire's Blog](https://lemire.me/blog/2023/04/07/programming-language-popularity-by-github-pull-requests/).

The gist of the story goes as follow:

- The most popular languages are JavaScript/TypeScript and Python with roughly 20% of all pull requests each. In effect, if you put JavaScript/TypeScript and Python together, you get about 40% of all pull requests.
- Then you get the second tier languages: Java and Scala, C/C++, and Go. They all are in the 10% to 15% range.
- Finally, you have PHP, Ruby and C# that all manage to get about 5% of all pull requests.
- Other languages are typically far below 5%.

Slint is a cross-platform native UI toolkit to provide user interfaces for any device. Initially focused on running on desktop-class machines and embedded devices that support OpenGL ES, a few months ago they started porting Slint to microcontrollers (MCUs). It's currently running well on Raspberry Pi Pico  - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/04/07/the-slint-1-0-gui-toolkit-ported-to-microcontrollers-opensource-piday-raspberry_pi-slint_ui/),  [Announcement](https://slint-ui.com/blog/porting-slint-to-microcontrollers.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint).

## Free Python Book Gets an Update

[![Python Book](../assets/20230411/20230411book.jpg)](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/l)

Think Python 2nd Edition by Allen B. Downey has been updated and released. While it's on Amazon for purchase, there are free [PDF](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) and [HTML](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) downloads by the author. There are also four language translations - [Green Tree Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/).

> Think Python is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming; it is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming, are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters.

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This week, I added board definitions for some upcoming Feather RP2040 boards to CircuitPython. I also added informational read-only properties to the WiFi API so you can tell if the board is connected or if it is running as an access point. Finally, I brought the Blinka  `_bleio` library up to date with latest version of the underlying library we use, bleak. Blinka `_bleio` allows you to use CircuitPython BLE code on a host computer. We had pinned versions in late 2020; there have been many improvements and fixes since then. Blinka `_bleio` now can run on Python 3.9 through 3.11.

The [Adafruit Feather RP2040 RFM69 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/feather-rp2040-rfm69) is live! This guide has everything you need to get started with your new board. It includes technical details, pinouts, demos for both CircuitPython and Arduino, downloads resources, and more. If you picked one of these up, check out this guide!

The Feather RP2040 RFM9x guide will follow shortly!

I've been working on troubleshooting some issues with 2 screen devices like the Monster M4sk, or others with 2 displays attached externally. Some of the recent changes to the displayio API needed some additional checks to ensure the terminal output group was not already being used before attempting to show it on displays as they are initialized and reset. There is also something going on resulting in hard crashes for some 2 display configurations during code  file saves or reboots with ctrl-C, I'm digging further into that to try to understand the root cause.

**Jeff**

I enhanced the abilities of the lesser known `synthio` module, which was contributed by community member @tyomitch back in 2021. Now, it can mix up to 12 notes (on rp2040 and mimxrt10xx ports) and general waveforms are supported, rather than only square waves. This work will be in the next 8.1.0 beta release.

For the next few weeks, I'll be traveling, spending some time in Utah's national parks, ending up at PyCon US 2023 from Friday through Tuesday. I'd love to meet anybody from the Adafruit and Python on Hardware community who is also attending *(Ed: see the article on PyCon US earlier in the newsletter)*.

**Scott**

I haven't done a ton this week because I've been out sick. When I've had time, I've continued working on CIrcuitPython on the iMX RT. I got the 117x series kind of working so I moved back to the 10xx. Specifically I got the 1042 working and am now working on the 1015. After I get these new chips supported, I'll be focusing on optimizing flash settings. In the worst case, code to execute and data is loaded from flash. So, the faster that happens, the faster CircuitPython runs.

**Liz**

This week I added pages for PWM audio and I2S audio in the [Metro M7 1011 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m7-with-airlift). I also updated the [2.7" eInk guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-7-eink-display-breakouts-and-shields) with a page for EYESPI for the updated version of the display.
