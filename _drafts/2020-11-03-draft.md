More, more BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)!

I finished up the [CircuitPython BLE Libraries on Any Computer](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-libraries-on-any-computer) guide, which shows how to use the adafruit-blinka library to run CircuitPython BLE code and libraries on Windows, MacOS, and Linux (including Raspberry Pi).

And, I've added a longish shared [guide page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-airlift-breakout/circuitpython-ble) to all the AirLift board product pages describing how to use the ESP32 AirLift co-processor in BLE mode, instead of its usual WiFi mode. You can now use other BLE devices to talk to AirLift-equipped accessory or development boards, such as the AirLift FeatherWing, the Metro M4 AirLift Lite, or the new MatrixPortal board.

[![Jeff](../assets/20201103/20201103jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Following up on adding canio to the ESP32-S2, it's another project with the ESP32-S2!  I'm investigating support for AudioOut and I2SOut.  Both peripherals are available in the microcontroller, but I have to write the core code to make it all work.  I've switched from the Kaluga devkit to the new Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2 Express.  So far it's all a work in progress, but maybe horrible distorted noises will come out of a speaker soon!luc

**Kattni**

The [QT Py Activity Timer and Hydration Reminder](https://learn.adafruit.com/qt-py-activity-timer-and-hydration-reminder) guide was published. If you're the type of person who gets hyperfocused and forgets to take breaks or eat lunch, or you want a periodic reminder to stay hydrated, check out this guide. It's a compact little LED ring sandwich that sits on your desk, with entirely customisable code. The guide covers assembly and how to customise the code to fit your needs.

I also added a Pinouts page to the existing Braincraft HAT guide. If you picked up one of these HATs and wanted the details about what's on it, check out this update.

Along with that, I published the [Adafruit Voice Bonnet](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-voice-bonnet) guide. The Voice Bonnet adds two mics and speakers to your Raspberry Pi. Everything you need to know, and details on getting up and running with it is available in this guide.

These past few weeks I've been taking some time off, working on an accumulation of life issues and some of my own projects. Some of it has been CPy related despite being off the clock, such as an SPI Peripheral module I need for a tracking system, and a new teeny Circuitpython enabled dev board I whipped together with JLCPCB:

[![Lucian](../assets/20201103/20201103lucian.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Now that I'm back, I'm switching over briefly to Arduino, to implement some of the improvements we made to the Neopixel on ESP32-S2 Circuitpython. The Neopixel libraries on Arduino don't yet use the ESP32's RMT module (ReMoTe controller module), which is usually used for IR but is also capable of emulating high speed protocols like the Neopixel's. I'm also reading up on the ESP32-S2 network layers so I can better assist Scott with those kinds of projects.

**Melissa**

This past week has mostly been about e-ink displays. I've been working on updating a the e-ink breakouts guide to be a more all inclusive guide. I started with adding our new 2.9" Grayscale e-ink display, which required ensuring the software support was in place, so there were a lot of arduino library updates. 

I also added a number of 2.9" Tri-Color e-Ink display pages to [the same guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eink-display-breakouts). Some of the changes that were made to examples were coming up with a common pinout for wiring up the breakouts so that the user only needed to make only minimal changes to the examples to use them with the FeatherWings and Breakouts. This was a different approach than the old examples which had the wiring chosen to make the wiring diagrams clearer.
