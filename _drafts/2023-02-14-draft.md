## The Raspberry Pi Pico Software Developer Kit Version 1.5.0 Released

[![Raspberry Pi Pico Software Developer Kit](../assets/20230214/20230214sdk.jpg)](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/releases/tag/1.5.0)

The official C++ Raspberry Pi Pico Software Developer Kit Version 1.5.0 has been released. While there are many, many fixes and enhancements, the standout is Bluetooth support for the Raspberry Pi Pico W - [GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/releases/tag/1.5.0).

Per [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-sdk-adds-bluetooth), "With Bluetooth support, the Pico W can be used to create a wireless mouse, wireless keyboard or other peripheral (Bluetooth audio does not appear to be supported). So you can just imagine creating your own DIY mouse jiggler, but operating over Bluetooth instead of USB."

The CircuitPython development team states this will allow CircuitPython to also support Pico W Bluetooth but no estimate when this may happen. At the moment, MicroPython also does not support Bluetooth for the Pico W but it is also likely in the future.

## Tulip is a Complete Computer Running MicroPython

[![Tulip](../assets/20230214/20230214tulip.jpg)](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc)

The Tulip Creative Computer (aka Tulip, aka Tulip CC) is a self contained portable creative computer, with a display and keyboard and sound. It boots instantaneously into a MicroPython prompt. Tulip is not a shell on top of another operating system. The entire system is dedicated to code, the display and sound, running in real time, on specialized hardware - [GitHub](https://github.com/bwhitman/tulipcc).

> You can build your own Tulip CC for about $25 plus the cost of a display ($50) and USB keyboard. The hardware for revision 4 of Tulip CC is based on the ESP32-S3 dual core microcontroller running at 240MHz. This single inexpensive chip can support all of Tulip's functionality at low power use. It can last on any USB battery pack or LiPo battery for many hours. The display we use is a 10.1" 1024 x 600 RGB dot clock color LCD with capacative touch support. Tulip's sound system is a full featured 32-voice synthesizer with a stereo line-out / headphone jack. You can use speakers or other connectors instead.

## GitHub Claims Source Code Search Engine is a Game Changer

[![GitHub Source Code Search Engine](../assets/20230214/20230214gs.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/07/github_code_search/)

GitHub has a lot of code to search – more than 200 million repositories – and says last November's beta version of a search engine optimized for source code that has caused a "flurry of innovation." GitHub Engineer Timothy Clem [delved](https://github.blog/2023-02-06-the-technology-behind-githubs-new-code-search/) into the technology used to scour just a quarter of those repos, a code search engine built in Rust called Blackbird. Blackbird currently provides access to almost 45 million GitHub repositories, which together amount to 115TB of code and 15.5 billion documents - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/07/github_code_search/) and [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2023-02-06-the-technology-behind-githubs-new-code-search/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0 final on February 6. Thank you everyone who worked on 8.0.0, reported issues, and tried out the early releases!

I'm now working on safemode.py, which will run if you go into safe mode, so you can recover programatically instead of having to press the reset button. The code is fairly simple, but I will test it in practice to see exactly what semantics are best.

**Kattni**

This week I put together the Adafruit ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT Feather guide. It's essentially the same as the TFT Feather, but the display is on the bottom of the board, and there are two extra buttons for use as inputs. The display on the bottom makes it great for projects where you want to mount it with the display facing out, without dealing with all of the other components found on the Feather. The guide covers everything you need to get started with your Reverse TFT Feather. Check it out!

I also have a timelapse setup running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, to watch a plant bloom. This is an extra special blooming, as it is an air plant, and this type only blooms once. Once I have the photo series, I will be writing up a guide on how to do this process from start to finish. Barring some quirky issues I ran into during Pi set up, it's pretty simple to get going. Keep an eye out for that sometime in March!

**Melissa**

This past week I took a bit of a detour and updated the drivers and [guide for the 0.96" Mini TFT Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-tft-0-dot-96-inch-180x60-breakout). I also fixed an issue with the driver for the Crickit HAT for the Raspberry Pi because it was having an issue with driving stepper motors due to a bug in one of the dependencies. Once that was out of the way, I continued working on the CircuitPython Installer and hope to finish that up soon.

**Tim**

This week I worked on testing some PRs for the HTTPServer library and a few other small ones. I've also been working on adding argument validation inside of the core to displayio classes to more gracefully handle when the user passes values that are not possible or valid.

**Jeff**

I've fixed a couple of bugs reported by users of 8.0.0:

* On all RP2040 boards, reduced the drive strength of PIO output pins. This fixed a USB CDC disconnect bug on Scorpio.
* Fixed a problem with chained exceptions, generator.close(), and auto-reload

We'll keep making the 8.0.x release series the best CircuitPython ever!

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on pysigrok. I've added analog support, board pin names and trigger support. I'm working on adding protocol decoding to sigrok-cli in addition to the existing test harness.

**Liz**

This week I published the [CircuitPython OctoPrint Controller and Monitor guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-octoprint-controller-and-monitor). The project uses MQTT to send and receive messages to OctoPrint via two plugins with Adafruit IO acting as the broker. For hardware, I used the new ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT Feather. The orientation of the screen makes it easy to panel mount for projects, so I tried to show that off with the octopus-themed case that I designed.
