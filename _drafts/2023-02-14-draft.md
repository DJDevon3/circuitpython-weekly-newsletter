## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230214/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0 final on February 6. Thank you everyone who worked on 8.0.0, reported issues, and tried out the early releases!

I'm now working on safemode.py, which will run if you go into safe mode, so you can recover programatically instead of having to press the reset button. The code is fairly simple, but I will test it in practice to see exactly what semantics are best.

**Kattni**

This week I put together the Adafruit ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT Feather guide. It's essentially the same as the TFT Feather, but the display is on the bottom of the board, and there are two extra buttons for use as inputs. The display on the bottom makes it great for projects where you want to mount it with the display facing out, without dealing with all of the other components found on the Feather. The guide covers everything you need to get started with your Reverse TFT Feather. Check it out!

I also have a timelapse setup running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, to watch a plant bloom. This is an extra special blooming, as it is an air plant, and this type only blooms once. Once I have the photo series, I will be writing up a guide on how to do this process from start to finish. Barring some quirky issues I ran into during Pi set up, it's pretty simple to get going. Keep an eye out for that sometime in March!

**Melissa**

This past week I took a bit of a detour and updated the drivers and [guide for the 0.96" Mini TFT Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-tft-0-dot-96-inch-180x60-breakout). I also fixed an issue with the driver for the Crickit HAT for the Raspberry Pi because it was having an issue with driving stepper motors due to a bug in one of the dependencies. Once that was out of the way, I continued working on the CircuitPython Installer and hope to finish that up soon.

**Tim**

This week I worked on testing some PRs for the HTTPServer library and a few other small ones. I've also been working on adding argument validation inside of the core to displayio classes to more gracefully handle when the user passes values that are not possible or valid.

**Jeff**

I've fixed a couple of bugs reported by users of 8.0.0:

* On all RP2040 boards, reduced the drive strength of PIO output pins. This fixed a USB CDC disconnect bug on Scorpio.
* Fixed a problem with chained exceptions, generator.close(), and auto-reload

We'll keep making the 8.0.x release series the best CircuitPython ever!

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on pysigrok. I've added analog support, board pin names and trigger support. I'm working on adding protocol decoding to sigrok-cli in addition to the existing test harness.

**Liz**

This week I published the [CircuitPython OctoPrint Controller and Monitor guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-octoprint-controller-and-monitor). The project uses MQTT to send and receive messages to OctoPrint via two plugins with Adafruit IO acting as the broker. For hardware, I used the new ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT Feather. The orientation of the screen makes it easy to panel mount for projects, so I tried to show that off with the octopus-themed case that I designed.
