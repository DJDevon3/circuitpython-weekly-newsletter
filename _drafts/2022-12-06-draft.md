## 100 CircuitPython Blinka Compatible Single Board Computers!

[![100 CircuitPython Blinka Compatible Single Board Computers](../assets/20221206/20221206blinka100.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/11/29/celebrating-100-single-board-computers-that-support-circuitpython-blinka-blinka-circuitpython-sbc-adafruit/)

CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards.

Blinka brings CircuitPython APIs and, therefore, CircuitPython libraries to single board computers (SBCs). It is a pip installable Python library that runs in normal "desktop" Python (The CircuitPython runtime isn’t used). CircuitPython libraries can also be installed via pip.

Interested? See the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux) on how to use Blinka with supported SBCs (like [Raspberry Pi](https://circuitpython.org/blinka?q=raspberry+pi), [Beagle](https://circuitpython.org/blinka?q=beagle) and more) - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/11/29/celebrating-100-single-board-computers-that-support-circuitpython-blinka-blinka-circuitpython-sbc-adafruit/).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221206/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!
