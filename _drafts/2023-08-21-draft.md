Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Wow! CircuitPython Day was full of broadcasts celebrating Python on microcontrollers and single-board computers! Thanks to all who participated this year! A new bump in CircuitPython version was released. CircuitPython 8.x builds will start to get rare as the team is working on version 9.0 with some additions from MicroPython, USB Host support and more. But can it blend? The ESP32-S3 has been demonstrating running real Linux! A huge worldwide effort is underway to get this perfected. And so much more this week. *- Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## CircuitPython 8.2.3 Released!

[![CircuitPython 8.2.3 Released](../assets/20230821/20230821cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/08/11/circuitpython-8-2-3-released/)

CircuitPython 8.2.3, the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, and is a new stable release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/08/11/circuitpython-8-2-3-released/) and [Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.2.3).

## Getting Linux running on an ESP32-S3

[![Getting Linux running on an ESP32-S3](../assets/20230821/20230821linux.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng1on8prlYo)

Ladyada at Adafruit has been hacking on a community project to get a version of Linux running on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller. She's had success using Docker to run Linux builds when other methods have had issues. Now WiFi and a number of other features works under Linux! - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng1on8prlYo).

> The Dockerfile was fun to put together, a little like a text adventure where you have to figure out the exact order of commands to get the [babel fish](https://www.ifwiki.org/Babel_fish_puzzle) but now when run, it will automagically pop out the right files AND you can always terminal into the docker image at the end to customize and re-compile quickly. You can check out the Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/pull/2589/files) and if you want to just download the container image post-compilation check it out [here](https://login.docker.com/u/login/identifier?state=hKFo2SBvajVES3p1TlI4ZDB2RHJReVFtSWFBLXlqc2w1ajR2UqFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIHJ1RnJzczBPclE3X05IRUVXUEVlaVZfVEM2bEVGRFpyo2NpZNkgbHZlOUdHbDhKdFNVcm5lUTFFVnVDMGxiakhkaTluYjk) (Docker login needed).

## Big European Companies form RISC-V Venture

[![RISC-V Venture](../assets/20230821/20230821riscv.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/04/chip_companies_risc_v/)

The RISC-V open instruction set architecture got a boost today after it emerged that five chip giants are coming together to jointly invest in a company to develop reference architectures based on the standard. The new entity will be formed in Germany with investment from Infineon Technologies, Qualcomm, NXP Semiconductors, Bosch, and Nordic Semiconductor, with the aim of speeding up "the commercialization of future products based on the open-source RISC-V architecture." - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/04/chip_companies_risc_v/).

## This Week's Python Streams

[![Python Streams](../assets/20230821/cccircuitpython.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

## Project of the Week: Recreating the TARS Robot from Interstellar

[![TARS Robot](../assets/20230821/20230821tars.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/charlesdiaz/how-to-build-your-own-replica-of-tars-from-interstellar-224833)

Charlie Diaz describes making a miniature version of the robot TARS from the movie Interstellar - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/charlesdiaz/how-to-build-your-own-replica-of-tars-from-interstellar-224833).

> "I’ve been working to create my own miniature replica of the robot TARS from the movie Interstellar. The goal was always to make a reasonably faithful representation of TARS walk like it did in the movie. I’ve made three versions so far and have gone from a functional but unreliable proof-of-concept to a more refined and highly reliable prototype capable of walking continuously for hours."

Under the hood, TARS uses Python code running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. Controlling servos is an Adafruit PCA-9685 Servo Driver. The chassis is 3D printed over an aluminum extrusion chassis.

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I finished code merging for the merge of MicroPython V1.19.1 into CircuitPython, and made a draft [pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8281). Jeff and I are now cleaning up the remaining build and test issues. When those are all resolved, I'll remove it as a draft and then it will be reviewed.

I tried to reduce the number of changes that had existed between CircuitPython and MicroPython in the core interpreter, to make the next merge easier. Necessary changes were also marked in many cases with an indication that the change was deliberately made for CircuitPython. This will save time during later merges because the origin of the changes will be more obvious.

**Kattni**

This week I've been working on the Metro ESP32-S3 guide. It's coming soon in the shop. The guide should be ready by the time it's available to purchase. It'll have everything you need to get started with your new Metro. Keep an eye out for that.

I participated in a CircuitPython Day panel discussion about `synthio`, and a CircuitPython Day Chat with Jeff and Dan. As this was written before CircuitPython Day, I will include any fun details and links to the videos in next week's newsletter.

**Melissa**

[![title](../assets/20230821/20230821melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

text - [site](url).

**Tim**

This week I wrote Python scripts to compare data from the OSHWA API with a full list of Adafruit PIDs to find any remaining that haven't been submitted. The resulting list was narrowed a bit further and I've begun submitting requests for the ones that need it. I've also done some testing on new features for `ImageLoad` that add support for additional types of BMP images that can be exported from GIMP and other editing software.

**Jeff**

My main accomplishment for the week has been to help out Dan with the MicroPython merge. MicroPython and CircuitPython share a large number of tests that are run automatically with each change. Most of these test the behavior of the language itself, not hardware, but they are extremely valuable because they can find the tiniest flaws in the core code.

We started with a large number of test failures, and have shared in fixing them. Frequently, a cluster of failures is fixed by a single change. As I write this, we've gone from over 100 tests to check to only about a dozen left to understand and (hopefully) fix.

**Scott**

This week I've been bouncing between USB host work and updating the PR to update the ESP-IDF to version 5. The IDF 5 update supports newer chips from Espressif but also changes some APIs and increases code size. microdev did the necessary API updates and increased the build size of CircuitPython. This will break folks' CIRCUITPY drive so I'm looking at the cause for the size increase before deciding to do this breakage.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a guide for the [PC joystick to seesaw adapter](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pc-joystick-to-seesaw-i2c-adapter). There are pages for pinouts, CircuitPython and Python, Arduino and downloadable resources. I had actually never used a PC joystick before, so I had to procure one on eBay for testing but luckily it worked really well. I'm hoping to maybe do a project with it at some point.
