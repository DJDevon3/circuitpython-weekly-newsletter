## CircuitPython 7.1.0 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.1.0 Released](../assets/20220104/20220104cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/12/28/circuitpython-7-1-0-released/)

CircuitPython 7.1.0, the latest minor revision of CircuitPython, was just released - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/12/28/circuitpython-7-1-0-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/7.1.0).

**Notable additions to 7.1.0 since 7.0.0:**

* Initial port for Raspberry Pi Broadcom-based boards.
* Preliminary support for `asyncio` cooperative multitasking.
* `bitmaptools`: dithering and alphablend are new.</li
* `keypad.Event`s now include timestamps.
* `framebufferio`: support for IS31FL3741.
* Espressif now provides `I2CPeripheral`, WiFi monitor mode, setting MAC address, ESP32-C3 support, ParallelImageCapture.
* `gifio.GifWriter` is new.
* HID now provides boot device and feature report support.
* `rotaryio` now allows setting the divisor of counts per transition.
* SAMD now provides `watchdog`, and `alarm` with sleep.
* SAMx5 boards now all have sleep support.
* The STM port now provides STM32L4R5 support.
* MicroPython 1.17 has been merged in.
* Russian translation.

**Port status:**

CircuitPython has a number of “ports” that are the core implementations for different microcontroller families. Stability varies on a per-port basis. As of this release, atmel-samd, cxd56 (Spresense), esp32s2, nrf, raspberrypi, stm for the F4 family are stable. stm for other STM chip families is being actively improved but may be missing functionality and have bugs. broadcom (Raspberry Pi) "bare metal", litex and mimxrt10xx are in an alpha state and will have bugs and missing functionality.

## CircuitPython in 2022

[![CircuitPython in 2022](../assets/20220104/20220104cp2022.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/01/circuitpython-in-2022-circuitpython2022-circuitpython/)

As 2022 starts, let's take some time to share our goals for CircuitPython in 2022. Just like past years (full summary [2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), and [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/)), we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

Here are a few ways to post:

- a video on YouTube
- [a post on the CircuitPython forum](https://forums.adafruit.com/posting.php?mode=post&f=60)
- a blog post on your site
- a series of Tweets
- a [Gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/)

We want to hear from you. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2022 and email circuitpython2022@adafruit.com to let us know about your post so we can blog it up here.

The post can cover any topic related to CircuitPython. See more at [https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython2022](https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython2022).

## Work in Progress: Floppy Disk Interfacing with Microcontrollers

[![Floppy disk I/O](../assets/20220104/20220104floppy1.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/01/low-cost-and-easily-available-floppy-interface-hardware-part-9-pico-power/)

Adafruit has been working diligently on using low cost microcontrollers to interface with floppy disk drives. There is active interest from the archival, maker and retrocomputer communities in working with floppy disks. Lots of folks want to get possibly valuable data off old disks. Ladyada has now developed Arduino code for the inexpensive Raspberry Pi Pico to work with 3.5" drives, with additional work on the way - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/01/low-cost-and-easily-available-floppy-interface-hardware-part-9-pico-power/).

[![Adafruit Floppy](../assets/20220104/rabbit.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Floppy)

Adafruit Floppy is a project to make a flexible, full-stack, open source hardware/software device for reading, archiving, accessing and duplicating floppy disk media - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Floppy).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220104/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made releases for both CircuitPython 7.1.0 final and 7.2.0-alpha.1 on Tuesday, December 28, 2021. 7.1.0 is a new stable release. 7.1.0-rc.0 had some mild changes, resulting in 7.1.0-rc.1, and 7.1.0-rc.1 seemed to be fine, so we re-released it as 7.1.0 final.

I'll be working on more `asyncio` examples for the [Cooperative Multitasking](https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython-with-asyncio) guide, and considering some new features for it as well.

**Jeff**

Rather than take on any substantial coding work, I instead finished up a 3D printed project with LEDs. A guide for making your own will probably be published on the Learn system by the time you read this, check for a link in the new guides section of the newsletter.

I've also taken some time to reflect on what we've accomplished together in 2021. For me, some of the high points of progress have been adding asyncio, getting "up to date" with MicroPython, and adding support for fun hardware like camera modules.

On a personal note, I'm grateful to get to know Damien and Jimmo from the MicroPython project a little better, and that I was able to visit Adafruit in NYC and participate in-person on an Ask an Engineer broadcast.

Thank you to everyone who has shared their CircuitPython projects in this newsletter, on Discord, Twitter, and elsewhere. It's incredible and humbling to know that I have played some small role in these meaningful, creative, insightful and inspiring projects.

**Scott**

This is a short week for me because I'm taking two days off around the holidays. The last two days have been spent working on Raspberry Pi Zero support for CircuitPython. This will broaden the supported boards and hopefully provide some perspective on the SD card issues that have been plaguing the broadcom port. I'm debugging the Zero support today and will hopefully get it going and out for merge today. :crossed_fingers:

I'll be kicking off #CircuitPython2022, so start brainstorming where you want CP to go in the new year.
