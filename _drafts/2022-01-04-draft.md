## CircuitPython 7.1.0 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.1.0 Released](../assets/20220104/20220104cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/12/28/circuitpython-7-1-0-released/)

CircuitPython 7.1.0, the latest minor revision of CircuitPython, was just released - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/12/28/circuitpython-7-1-0-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/7.1.0).

**Notable additions to 7.1.0 since 7.0.0:**

* Initial port for Raspberry Pi Broadcom-based boards.
* Preliminary support for `asyncio` cooperative multitasking.
* `bitmaptools`: dithering and alphablend are new.</li
* `keypad.Event`s now include timestamps.
* `framebufferio`: support for IS31FL3741.
* Espressif now provides `I2CPeripheral`, WiFi monitor mode, setting MAC address, ESP32-C3 support, ParallelImageCapture.
* `gifio.GifWriter` is new.
* HID now provides boot device and feature report support.
* `rotaryio` now allows setting the divisor of counts per transition.
* SAMD now provides `watchdog`, and `alarm` with sleep.
* SAMx5 boards now all have sleep support.
* The STM port now provides STM32L4R5 support.
* MicroPython 1.17 has been merged in.
* Russian translation.

**Port status:**

CircuitPython has a number of “ports” that are the core implementations for different microcontroller families. Stability varies on a per-port basis. As of this release, atmel-samd, cxd56 (Spresense), esp32s2, nrf, raspberrypi, stm for the F4 family are stable. stm for other STM chip families is being actively improved but may be missing functionality and have bugs. broadcom (Raspberry Pi) "bare metal", litex and mimxrt10xx are in an alpha state and will have bugs and missing functionality.

## CircuitPython in 2022

[![CircuitPython in 2022](../assets/20220104/20220104cp2022.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/01/circuitpython-in-2022-circuitpython2022-circuitpython/)

As 2022 starts, let's take some time to share our goals for CircuitPython in 2022. Just like past years (full summary [2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), and [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/)), we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

Here are a few ways to post:

- a video on YouTube
- [a post on the CircuitPython forum](https://forums.adafruit.com/posting.php?mode=post&f=60)
- a blog post on your site
- a series of Tweets
- a [Gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/)

We want to hear from you. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2022 and email circuitpython2022@adafruit.com to let us know about your post so we can blog it up here.

The post can cover any topic related to CircuitPython. See more - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/01/circuitpython-in-2022-circuitpython2022-circuitpython/).

## News from around the web!

[![New minimal CircuitPython keyboard library](../assets/20220104/20220104keylib.jpg)](https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb)

ukeeb: a new minimal CircuitPython keyboard library for CircuitPython- [GitHub](https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb) and [Keyboard News Digest](https://kbd.news/Kleks-keyboard-1161.html).

Above is the kleks keyboard, a low-profile monoblock split with extreme pinky stagger and strange but cool-looking circular routing by Radomir (aka deshipu) who also authored ukeeb.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220104/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).
