## CircuitPython Project Bundle

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210518/20210518pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210518/20210518pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210518/20210518pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am fixing bugs for CircuitPython 6.x and 7.0.0, and will continue to do that in the near future.

Now that the first version of dynamic USB descriptors is merged in, there are some more features to be added. First, I'll be looking at supporting "boot"-profile keyboards. Currently all CircuitPython HID devices are merged into a single "composite" HID device. This saves USB endpoints, which are a scarce resource. But the simple BIOS code on your computer typically does not understand these composite devices. The BIOS _can_ recognize a single HID keyboard device, which is specially marked as being a "boot" keyboard. The BIOS assumes that all boot keyboards are the same and have the same report descriptor, so it does not actually read it. So I'll add the ability to define and use boot devices. 

**Jeff**

I continued helping Scott test the micropython "merges" and fixed a bunch of resulting problems. I think we're done for now, at least until micropython releases version 1.16.

I made some changes that allowed all of the micropython "natmod" examples to compile, and tested some of them on a host computer. "natmod" is a way to write code in a subset of C that gets compiled to a "mpy" file which can then be loaded on a microcontroller with "import". I didn't test or enable it for any CircuitPython boards yet so if you're motivated to use this feature, please come help us out with this.

Speaking of Micropython, I've opened several Pull Requests there that have generated interest, and I've also seen renewed interest in one that I first opened in 2018. These PRs help speed up the process of testing micropython, and address a few obscure bugs.

Last of all, I've been working on supporting RGBMatrix on ESP32-S2 microcontrollers in CircuitPython. This was available in Arduino but we neglected to add it to CircuitPython. At the moment, it works well enough to show a demo but there are still some bugs to fix before it can be turned into a Pull Request.

**Kattni**

This week I published [the guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder) for the [Adafruit I2C QT Rotary Encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991). This guide has everything you need to get started using your rotary encoder breakout with both Arduino and CircuitPython, as well as pinouts and downloads resources.

I updated the blink program on the Welcome to CircuitPython: Creating and Editing Code page to use `board.LED` in the code. It previously use `board.D13` which not all boards supported, for example, Raspberry Pi Pico. The issue was that not all Adafruit boards supported `board.LED`, which was what we use in the Blink template anyway. So, I went through and added the `LED` pin to 31 more boards in CircuitPython. This update is only available in the absolute newest version of CircuitPython, so if you run into an issue with the pin not being found, try using the "Absolute Newest" version of CircuitPython for your board. Eventually, we will release another stable version with these updates, but I'm not certain when.

**Lucian**

This week I spent on bugfixes and catchup - I resolved a boot issue on an STM32 board caused by outdated clock settings, tracked down a few more issues with deep sleep on the RP2040, fixed the circuitpython-adjacent RMT settings for the Arduino Neopixel library, and dove into the guts of set-next-file.

**Melissa**

This past week, I finally had the opportunity to use MicroPython. Blinak, our CircuitPython compatibility layer which runs on Single Board Computers such as the Raspberry Pi was originally written to run on MicroPython. However, over the year it hadn't really been tested as new boards were added. So I went through and tested it all out, fixed Digitalio, I2C, SPI, and UART and in the process, I added the Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython. Be sure to keep an eye out for an upcoming guide or if you're feeling brave, you can download it to try it your board right now from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka.

**Scott**

1.15 was just merged in! So, we're just over 100 commits away from the newest MicroPython code. We've merged in the code from the latest release. I chatted with Damien and Jim and we're hoping to move to a shared `py` core. There are a few changes to upstream and we have a plan to see how it goes.

Now that the merge is done, we'll start doing alpha releases. They'll be a bit unstable but should have some good stuff including dynamic USB descriptors thanks to Dan. I'm working on making the status LED blinking lower power but have a bug to fix on SAMD before I can merge it in.

After that, I'll be back on BLE workflow.
