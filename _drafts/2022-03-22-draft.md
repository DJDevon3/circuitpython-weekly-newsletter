## CircuitPython 7.2.3 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.2.3](../assets/20220315/20220315p7.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

CircuitPython 7.2.3, the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, was released and it's the new stable release - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

**Notable fixes to 7.2.3 since 7.2.0**

* Espressif I2C pull-up detection fix.
* SAMD21 auto-reload reliability. In addition, for auto-reloads on any board, the program will stop more quickly, and will wait 0.75 seconds (was 0.5 seconds) after the last filesystem write before restarting.
* Update known certificates.
* Fix `countio` problems when used outside of code.py.
* Add `from __future__ import` annotations to allow program compatibility with CPython.
* Fix spurious `ReloadExceptions` when in the REPL.
* Improve auto-reload logic to avoid triggering multiple reloads, especially on RP2040 and macOS.
* Re-enable `_bleio` and remove frozen `PortalBase` on Adafruit MatrixPortal.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## New Learn Guides!

There are no new Python on hardware related Learn guides from Adafruit this week. Keep an eye out for more next week!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220322/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **349**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

After releasing CircuitPython 7.2.1 on Monday of last week, we found another problem with auto-reload, released 7.2.2 on Tuesday, and then found yet another problem on Wednesday and released 7.2.3 the same day. There is one remaining problem but it is less pervasive. Our aim is not to make a new release every day, even if it keeps CircuitPython in the news (lol), but when we must, we do. We also need to thoroughly test a fix instead of just making sure it fixes the original problem. These particular bugs we fixed don't lend themselves to easy automated testing, but we should think about how to do that.

**Jeff**

Thanks to some recently-merged changes in fluxengine, reading and writing Apple ][ disks on a TEAC floppy drives and the Adafruit Floppy prototype board is working really well. I posted up a video showing me use a disk written this way on a real Apple //e. [Check it out on the Adafruit YouTube Channel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU6eMyiT2TM&list=PLjF7R1fz_OOWexf2WmY8cgM65ltPaAvyT)

**Kattni**

This week, I've been working with Liz to get her spun up on creating new product guides. She's been picking everything up super quickly and is doing a fantastic job! She's already put at least two new guides into moderation. Next up is showing Liz how to do the guide updates for boards for which we've released a STEMMA QT revision. I'm sure she'll make quick work of this as well!

I started a personal-but-work-tangential project, porting a CircuitPython Timestamper written by Tim for MacroPad to the NeoKey FeatherWing. In doing so, I found a massive bug in CircuitPython 7.2.0 stable. That's since been fixed, and a new release made. Glad we figured it out quickly!

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on a bunch of CircuitPython code including rewriting some Google Calendar examples for the MagTag and PyPortal so that it works on the latest version of CircuitPython. I also wrote some examples for using the new 1.47" and 1.9" TFT displays.

**Tim**

I hosted the CircuitPython weekly meeting for the second time this week. It's been great to be able to step in to the rotation of folks that host. I noticed that I've begun to start feeling more comfortable and natural while hosting. I went over the process for applying patches to most/all library repositories with Kattni and Eva. I also streamed the first Deep Dive w/ Tim episode this week filling in while Scott is away. On the show I worked on creating async based displayio examples.

**Scott**

This last week, I've been switching between working on the ESP32-S3 and fixing/improving autoreload on CircuitPython. On the ESP32-S3, I took a look at some sleep issues. One issue was fixed with an ESP IDF update and the other appears to be an existing IDF bug, so I'll file an issue for it. I then had an idea for a web workflow that uses MDNS to discover local CircuitPython devices. I'm currently adding MDNS support for testing out this idea. I'll soon be on paternity leave, so we'll see how far I get.

**Liz**

This was my first week full-time with Adafruit! I've been working with Kattni to learn how to write the new product Learn Guides. We started with the VL53L4CD STEMMA board. I've also been working on a video mixer with Processing on a Raspberry Pi, which will have hardware controls with Blinka.
