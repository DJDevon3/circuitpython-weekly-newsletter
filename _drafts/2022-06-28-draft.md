## Espressif Introduces the ESP32-C5: their first Dual-Band Wi-Fi 6 MCU

[![ESP32-C5](../assets/20220628/20220628c5.jpg)](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C5)

Espressif Systems announced the release of their ESP32-C5, a highly integrated microcontroller with 2.4 and 5 GHz dual-band Wi-Fi 6, as well as Bluetooth 5 (LE) connectivity. The ESP32-C5 is a follow-up to the ESP32-C6 SoC, which was announced last year. It has a 32-bit, RISC-V, single-core processor which can clock up to 240 MHz. It has a 400KB SRAM, 384KB of ROM, and it works with external flash. It has more than 20 programmable GPIOs, supporting all commonly-used peripherals including security. Also included is an SDIO 2.0 peripheral interface - [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C5).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220628/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **357**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.3.1 this week. It includes the MatrixPortal DMA SPI fix I did last week, and several other fixes, some of which were backported from the `main` branch.

I've started to port CircuitPython to run on plain ESP32 microcontrollers, which don't have native USB support. The web workflow Scott is working on will make these quite usable, so we've decided to support these widely used chips.

**Kattni**

I wrapped up the [Create an Excellent GitHub Profile with Markdown](https://learn.adafruit.com/excellent-github-profile) guide. It explains the steps necessary to create a GitHub profile including creating the special profile repository with a README. It also covers some basic Markdown syntax, and how to edit the README. Then, the guide discusses what kind of content you might want to include to get you started if you're unsure where to begin. Finally, there is a section on creating your profile, beginning with the simplest option and moving through more advanced options, including a number of tools to add some enhancements to your profile. Whether this is entirely new to you, or you want to put some shine on your existing profile, this guide is meant for you!

**Tim**

I worked on an HTML page served by devices for editing files via the web workflow. I was able to integrate the page with some of the HTTP Request endpoints that Scott has set up on the working branch for web workflow to load and save files. I experimented with Javascript code editor modules and used one called "Ace" on the page which offers syntax highlighting, line numbers, and other code editing "quality of life" features. This week I also added some integer bounds validation on the arguments for a few of the functions on displayio.Palette object in the core. Previously it would allow values outside the range of indexes within the palette. Whilst adding these validations I learned about QTSTRs from some Micropython documentation to better understand where they come from and how to use them.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on the web workflow. I've added basic auth permissions to the file access, the ability to upload files, delete them and create directories. I also got it doing CORS headers so that other approved sites will be able to fetch data from the board. I'm continuing to polish things and will hopefully send out a PR early next week. The PR will cover device discovery and file system operations. Serial support will be added in a following PR.

**Liz**

I've been working on a cassette hacking project with JP. We are doing two different versions to demonstrate to folks how to control off the shelf tape decks for weird music effects with CircuitPython. My version is using a simple L9110 motor driver. A potentiometer affects the speed and direction of the motor in the cassette deck. I made a tape loop so that it can play forward and reverse without any issues. I think this guide will be really helpful for folks because you see a lot of tape projects out there in the music tech/synth communities, but you don't see a lot of step-by-step documentation on how to get started. This has also been nostalgic for me because I spent a lot of time making tapes up until 2018 because my car only had a tape deck that did not get along with the infamous iPod tape deck adapter. 

I also wrapped up the WipperSnapper pages for the [QT Py ESP32-S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-s3) and wrote some code for the [PyPortal Smart Mirror Weather Display guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/smart-mirror-with-pyportal).
