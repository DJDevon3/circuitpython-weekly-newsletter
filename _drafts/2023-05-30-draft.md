## Microsoft DeviceScript for Programming Microcontrollers

[![DeviceScript](../assets/20230530/20230530ds.jpg)](https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/)

Microsoft has quietly released a Technical Preview of DeviceScript. It brings a professional TypeScript developer experience to low-resource microcontroller-based devices. DeviceScript is compiled to a custom VM bytecode, which can run in very constrained environments. It uses a Visual Studio Code Extension to make an Integrated Development Environment with full debugging - [GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230530/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.1.0 final on Monday May 22, and followed quickly with CircuitPython. 8.2.0-beta.0 on Wednesday, May 24. It's great to have 8.1.0 out the door.

We'll continue to work on 8.2.0, which will probably appear as a stable release relatively soon. However, I'm also working toward the longer range goal of 9.0.0. The first task is to merge the MicroPython v1.19.1 changes; later someone else may do the v1.20 changes.

I also spruced up the Adafruit Forums a bit last week. I updated subforum titles and descriptions, and moved a few forums around.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Canary Nightlight](https://learn.adafruit.com/canary-nightlight) guide. In this project, you'll build a little glowing friend to watch over you from the outlet by the light switch. This 3D printed canary lights up blue when it's your time to be awake, and red when it's your time to sleep. As well, it watches over you by telling you when your internet is down by blinking red. The code is _super_ customisable, so you can change the timing, colors, and brightness to whatever works for you, or disable the network down detection if that isn't your thing. Not to put to fine a point on it, but you should definitely check out this guide!

**Melissa**

[![Storybook](../assets/20230530/20230530melissa.gif)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week, I worked with Erin to finish up the [Magic Storybook with ChatGPT learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/magic-storybook-with-chatgpt/usage). I wrote the Software Setup and Usage pages. I was able to fix the majority of the bugs, but being that this project is as complex as it is, there are likely some cases where bugs can occur. It was a joy to work with Erin and she kept me on my toes by finding bugs that I had overlooked.

**Tim**

This week I finalized testing and reviews on an update to the `HTTPServer` library that brings many new features and improved functionality. I've also submitted a few changes for the requests, and `websocket` libraries to allow more control over redirect behavior and headers sent to open the socket respectively. I've continued building an API for NeoPixels and DotStars on top of the upgraded `HTTPServer` library, dynamically import animations are the latest feature added.

**Jeff**

After several weeks of work, I think that CircuitPython's new synthesizer support is pretty complete. You can check it out in the new beta of CircuitPython 8.2! Thanks to all who helped educate me during this project. I can't wait to see what folks do with this new capability.

**Scott**

This week I've been bouncing between [MCU flasher](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCU_Flasher) and the [Pyrate](https://github.com/adafruit/Circuit_Pyrate/) code bases. MCU flasher needs a little reorg and polish. Pyrate has many more modes to implement. I got the prototype board, so I've been making that work fully. You can now toggle power supplies, pull ups and use SPI mode.

**Liz**

This week I published a guide for the new [ANO encoder STEMMA QT breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ano-rotary-navigation-encoder-to-i2c-stemma-qt-adapter). This breakout uses an ATtiny816 to run seesaw firmware. This makes wiring up one of these encoders super easy. It makes it so much easier that I started working on a project with five of them to build a synth using the new synthio module in CircuitPython. The circular shape of the encoders has inspired the evolution of the synth to use Euclidean rhythms and advance chords using the circle of fifths.
