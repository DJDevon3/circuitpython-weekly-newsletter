## The Python Language Summit 2023: What is the Standard Library for?

[![The Python Language Summit 2023: What is the Standard Library for?](../assets/20230530/20230530psf.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-summit-2023-what-is.html)

What is the Python Standard Library for? The [Python Language Summit](the Python Language Summit) looks to answer this question - [Python Blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-summit-2023-what-is.html).

>  "Overall, there was agreement that the original motivations for a large, 'batteries-included' standard library no longer held up to scrutiny. 'In the good old days,' Ned Deily reminisced, 'We said ‘batteries-included’ because we didn’t have a good story for third-party installation.' But in 2023, installing third-party packages from PyPI is much easier."

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230530/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.1.0 final on Monday May 22, and followed quickly with CircuitPython. 8.2.0-beta.0 on Wednesday, May 24. It's great to have 8.1.0 out the door.

We'll continue to work on 8.2.0, which will probably appear as a stable release relatively soon. However, I'm also working toward the longer range goal of 9.0.0. The first task is to merge the MicroPython v1.19.1 changes; later someone else may do the v1.20 changes.

I also spruced up the Adafruit Forums a bit last week. I updated subforum titles and descriptions, and moved a few forums around.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Canary Nightlight](https://learn.adafruit.com/canary-nightlight) guide. In this project, you'll build a little glowing friend to watch over you from the outlet by the light switch. This 3D printed canary lights up blue when it's your time to be awake, and red when it's your time to sleep. As well, it watches over you by telling you when your internet is down by blinking red. The code is _super_ customisable, so you can change the timing, colors, and brightness to whatever works for you, or disable the network down detection if that isn't your thing. Not to put to fine a point on it, but you should definitely check out this guide!

**Melissa**

[![Storybook](../assets/20230530/20230530melissa.gif)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week, I worked with Erin to finish up the [Magic Storybook with ChatGPT learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/magic-storybook-with-chatgpt/usage). I wrote the Software Setup and Usage pages. I was able to fix the majority of the bugs, but being that this project is as complex as it is, there are likely some cases where bugs can occur. It was a joy to work with Erin and she kept me on my toes by finding bugs that I had overlooked.

**Tim**

This week I finalized testing and reviews on an update to the `HTTPServer` library that brings many new features and improved functionality. I've also submitted a few changes for the requests, and `websocket` libraries to allow more control over redirect behavior and headers sent to open the socket respectively. I've continued building an API for NeoPixels and DotStars on top of the upgraded `HTTPServer` library, dynamically import animations are the latest feature added.

**Jeff**

After several weeks of work, I think that CircuitPython's new synthesizer support is pretty complete. You can check it out in the new beta of CircuitPython 8.2! Thanks to all who helped educate me during this project. I can't wait to see what folks do with this new capability.

**Scott**

This week I've been bouncing between [MCU flasher](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCU_Flasher) and the [Pyrate](https://github.com/adafruit/Circuit_Pyrate/) code bases. MCU flasher needs a little reorg and polish. Pyrate has many more modes to implement. I got the prototype board, so I've been making that work fully. You can now toggle power supplies, pull ups and use SPI mode.

**Liz**

This week I published a guide for the new [ANO encoder STEMMA QT breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ano-rotary-navigation-encoder-to-i2c-stemma-qt-adapter). This breakout uses an ATtiny816 to run seesaw firmware. This makes wiring up one of these encoders super easy. It makes it so much easier that I started working on a project with five of them to build a synth using the new synthio module in CircuitPython. The circular shape of the encoders has inspired the evolution of the synth to use Euclidean rhythms and advance chords using the circle of fifths.
