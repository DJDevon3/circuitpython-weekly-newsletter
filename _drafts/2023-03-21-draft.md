## MicroPython Support for the Raspberry Pi Pico W Has Started

[![MicroPython Support for the Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20230321/20230321blue.jpg)](https://twitter.com/Gadgetoid/status/1636442647144349697?t=NaTi1xaK-je6BgIqtejP6g&s=03)

Phil Howard at Pimoroni is working to complete a GitHub Pull Request for Raspberry Pi Pico W Bluetooth support to MicroPython. It's labeled as experimental at the moment. 

Phil notes 'Bluetooth works, you’ll want Adafruit’s “Bluefruit Connect” and the MicroPython “ble_simple_peripheral.py” and “ble_advertising.py” from [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/examples/bluetooth)' if you experimentally want to kick the tires - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Gadgetoid/status/1636442647144349697?t=NaTi1xaK-je6BgIqtejP6g&s=03) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/pull/716).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230321/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **413**!
