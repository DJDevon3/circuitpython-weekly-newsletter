## CircuitPython in 2023: Let the Devs Know Your Feelings - Last Week to do so!

[![CircuitPython in 2023](../assets/20230117/20230117cp23.jpg)](url)

As the year starts, the CircuitPython development team would like to take some time to share their goals for CircuitPython in 2023 and beyond. Just like past years (full summary [2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/), and [2022](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/01/thank-you-for-circuitpython2022/)), they’d like everyone in the Python on hardware community to contribute by posting their thoughts to a public place on the internet by Wednesday January 18th, 2023.

Here are a few ways to post:

* a video on YouTube
* a post on the CircuitPython forum
* a blog post on your site
* a post on Mastodon with tags #CircuitPython and #CircuitPython2023
* a Gist on GitHub

They want to hear from you. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2023 and email circuitpython2023@adafruit.com to let them know about your post so they can post it on the Adafruit Blog.

The post can cover any topic related to CircuitPython. See a suggested list and more in the post on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/). This includes any suggestions or comments related to this newsletter.

## Project of the Week: Castle in the Sky Laputa Stone

[![Castle in the Sky Laputa Stone](../assets/20230117/20230117potw1.jpg)](https://twitter.com/SteveKasuya2/status/1612743831333785604)

[![Castle in the Sky Laputa Stone](../assets/20230117/20230117potw2.gif)](https://twitter.com/SteveKasuya2/status/1612743831333785604)

Castle in the Sky is an iconic animated film by director Hayao Miyazaki. Set in a fictional late 19th century, it follows the adventures of a boy and girl who are trying to keep a powerful crystal from the army, a group of secret agents, and a family of pirates, while searching for a legendary floating castle, Laputa.

Steve Kasuya has recreated part of the movie in the form of a mysterious black stone with engraved glyphs. When a crystal is passed over it, it lights up strings of glyphs. It uses a Raspberry Pi Pico programmed in MicroPython - [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/SteveKasuya2/status/1612743831333785604).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230117/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've continued to work on bug fixes leading up to the CircuitPython 8.0.0 release. We have several bugs related to unreliable wifi, including things that supposedly worked better in 7.3.3. I've reproduced one that is related to socket timeouts and am now debugging it.

The special CYW43 "pass-through" pins on the Pico W have limited functionality and can be confusing to use. Based on a suggestion from Jeff,  I improved many of the type-checking error messages for arguments to native functions and methods.

**Kattni**

I'm back after a few weeks off for the holidays, and I'm getting back into the swing of things. This week was a lot of catch up and sorting out a priority for what to work on. I began working on a few product guides, some of which involve updating existing guides to include the new or updated product. If you've picked up any of our new products in the last couple of weeks, keep an eye out for the guides, coming out soon!

**Melissa**

[![CircuitPython Installer](../assets/20230117/20230117melissa.jpg)](https://code.circuitpython.org/)

This past week I've been working on the CircuitPython Installer. I ended up redesigning it from the ground up for the most part in order to have more of a wizard style UI. It's taking a bit longer than anticipated, but it's shaping up really nicely and connecting successfully to the board.

**Tim**

I've been working on the midi sequencer capabilities a little bit more, and starting to ramp back up on PR reviews after holiday break.

**Jeff**

[![Monitor](../assets/20230117/20230117jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org)

Aside from working on some bugs in CircuitPython, I also picked up a C library called PicoDVI and created a firmware based on it that emulates a SPI TFT display. With this firmware loaded on a PicoDV board, you can use any CircuitPython board with displayio to control a DVI/HDMI display with a virtual full color 400x240 framebuffer.

Right now this just exists as code in my github fork of the PicoDVI project, but working with Phil B. we hope to have this "emulator" released as an example within an Arduino library with .UF2 artifacts for easy installation.

**Scott**

Last week I got caught up after holiday time off. This week my partner is sick so I've got limited time to work while the baby naps. When I am at my desk, I'm keeping caught up so I can pick up bigger tasks once my partner feels better.

After keeping caught up, I'm fixing small bugs in our 8.0.0 milestone. I fixed a bug on ESP where light sleeping after waking up from a deep sleep was broken. I've got changes out for 1) fixing start and end kwargs for I2C, SPI and PIO when used with an array of multi-byte values and 2) sharing the MDNS web workflow object with the user so the user can do MDNS as well.

Lastly, we've got just under a week before the [#CircuitPython2023](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/) deadline. I've got a draft started that I need to grab screenshots for and finish writing.

**Liz**

I returned from vacation this week and wrote up some new product guides. The first was for the [3V to 5V booster board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-3v-to-5v-level-booster-breakout). The second was for the [PCA9546 4-Channel I2C Multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pca9546-4-channel-i2c-multiplexer), which allows you to use up to four I2C devices on the same address simultaneously. I added a new class to the [Adafruit_CircuitPython_TCA9548A](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TCA9548A) library for the PCA9546. The existing class for the xCA9548 chips did work with the PCA9546, but allowed for 8 devices. I thought this would be confusing for folks so the new class only allows for 4 devices.
