## PyCon US This Week: Python on Hardware Related Activities

[![PyCon US 2023](../assets/20230425/pycon2023.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2023/)

[PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/) is happening in Salt Lake City, Utah USA April 21 - 23 with Development Sprints April 24 - 27. Adafruit CircuitPython team members have been there hosting events! Kattni Rembor and Jeff Epler will be present, along with a few well-known community members. 

Kattni and Jeff managed Open Spaces during the conference. These Open Spaces have given folks an introduction to CircuitPython via the Circuit Playground Express. 

**Kattni will be hosting three days of Development Sprints from 8am-5pm on Monday April 24 through Wednesday April 26.** The location will be determined during the conference. The Sprints are an opportunity to contribute to the CircuitPython project, on the Python side of things, through code and documentation on CircuitPython Libraries. Everyone is welcome; there will still be all of the introduction to CircuitPython hardware, so there will be opportunities for folks at any level to participate.

Kattni states: "If you're attending, please let me know in the `#circuitpython-dev` channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord), or come find us around the conference. We'd love to meet up! We're looking forward to PyCon US 2023, and we hope you are too! See you there!" - [PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/).

**Next PyCon US: 2024 and 2025**

[![PyCon US: 2024](../assets/20230425/20230425p24.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2023/)

PyCon US 2024 will be held in Pittsburgh, PA from May 15-23, 2024 and also in Pittsburgh May 14-22, 2025.

## Work Progresses on Using an Adafruit Feather DVI with CircuitPython

[![Feather DVI with CircuitPython](../assets/20230425/20230425dvi.gif)](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1648738649637371909)

Turtle LOGO running nicely on the Feather DVI with CircuitPython. Ladyada rummaged through CircuitPython project-lead tannewt's GitHub branches to find this build of CircuitPython with DVI output support. Now you can treat any HDMI monitor as a display for CircuitPython! For example, above she is running ["turtle" demos](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) that show making cool graphical shapes, but to a display on the desk, via the [Feather RP2040 with DVI](https://adafruit.com/product/5710). The REPL also appears on the screen - how fun is that!? - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1648738649637371909).

## Awesome MIDI and Game Controller with CircuitPython

[![MIDI and Game Controller](../assets/20230425/20230425game.gif)](https://twitter.com/owntheweb/status/1650273862293262336)

Christopher Stevens had built a most remarkable MIDI controller. Based on an [Adafruit tutorial by John Park](https://learn.adafruit.com/neocontroller-color-grading-input-box), Christopher has taken this from a 4 to a 77 out of ten!  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/owntheweb/status/1650273862293262336).

He writes:

> This dual 3-axis joystick (HOSAS) features two microcontrollers: an Adafruit Metro Grand Central M4 for all the buttons and joysticks with exception of the NeoSliders and NeoKeys managed by a Feather RP2040 (pink!). Grand Central was great for all the inputs and timers for LED fades.<br> <br>Feather RP2040 managed I2C reads separately as it offered the cool factor, yet was a bit slower in reads per second than direct inputs handled the Grand Central. This turned out well for gaming purposes for fast controls with upper controls not needing that speed (less used).<br> <br> The game controller sends out low latency MIDI signals, which can be converted to joystick controls with an app like midi2vjoy. This is TBD, still exploring, rocking as a MIDI controller so far! Maybe I'll make a flight sim demo while also performing music at the same time?!!<br> <br>Both boards communicate with each other via UART at a basic level, syncing when that center ship power button is pressed (cool pulse in video) and to sync the continuous rainbow color rotation in all NeoPixels. It does utilize CircuitPython, super fun in this project!

## Project of the Week: The Imitator Pedal

[![The Imitator Pedal](../assets/20230425/20230425pedal.jpg)](url)

The Imitator "super karaoke" Pedal uses an artificial intelligence library called demucs to split any song into 4 tracks: vocal, drums, bass and others (which includes guitar, keyboards, winds, etc), and then you can use the pedal itself to control playback and mixing of those channels, with a rotary encoder assigned to each track.

It's all open hardware and open software, using a case from a Jícara instead of a metal case to lower the CO2 to produce the product.

In "white" mode, you can select the next or previous song from the ones already processed by the pedal. In "color" mode, you can mute/unmute the tracks, control their mixing volume, as well as pause/unpause by using the metal button.

The project runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 and has a Python web interface to talk to Azure Functions (which also has Python code on it) - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IGj-wyZRRc) and [GitHub](https://github.com/fede2cr/pedales).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

The Friday before this week, Scott and I triaged the 8.1.0 and 8.x.x issue lists. We assigned a number of issues, closed a few, and moved some others to 9.0.0 or Long Term. This will help us move toward 8.1.0 sooner.

I tested a new Espressif fix for I2C issues on ESP32-S3 and other chips. Unfortunately it doesn't fix the known I2C problems. But hope springs eternal when I see fixes this like.

I am working on a new introduction page for the Blinka guides.

**Kattni**

Kattni is attending PyCon US 2023 this week and leading Open Spaces and CircuitPython Sprints.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on writing the software for a collaborative project with Erin St. Blaine. This is basically an eBook that displays generated stories. The project involved taking care of formatting, animating, and displaying the text. Look for a guide in the coming weeks.

**Tim**

This week I've working on enhancements to the conference badge script for Kattni to use at Pycon. The new version has a scroll-able menu that can launch other demo scripts, with rainbow color neopixels while you scroll. It also contains remote control functionality so that other computers on the same WIFI network can use a browser page to change the neopixel colors. The other main thing I've worked on is some troubleshooting and a fix for an issue using the Si7021 sensor with Blinka on a Raspberry Pi.

**Scott**

This week I've been polishing [the DVI PR](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/7880). Thanks to Mark and Ladyada for testing and helping me fix issues.

Next up is some bug hunting for e-paper displays and then i.MX RT chips.

**Jeff**

Jeff is attending PyCon US 2023 this week and helping with Open Spaces and CircuitPython Sprints.

**Liz**

This week I updated the guide for the [ADT7410 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adt7410-breakout) to include the new STEMMA QT version. There's an updated pinouts page, new Fritzing diagrams and updated resources on the downloads page.

Next week I am attending Open Hardware Summit in New York City. I'm very excited for this since I had plans to attend the 2020 Summit which was moved online due to the pandemic. The line-up for talks looks great and I'm looking forward to being in-person for an event again.
