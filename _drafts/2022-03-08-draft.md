## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220308/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.2.0 final about ten days before this issue of the newsletter is published. We have more bugs to fix soon for 7.2.1 or 7.3.0. I'm working on several of these bugs.

I finished some shuffling of Python annotation types from the circuitpython source tree to the `circuitpython_typing` library. The types are used for generating stubs, and are also part of the documentation for core CircuitPython. Now we have a central place for adding new annotation types.

**Jeff**

For testing purposes, I've interfaced a Feather RP2040 to an Apple 2 floppy drive. Using CircuitPython, it's possible to position the read/write head, and obtain flux information from the floppy using the PIO peripheral. This just for experimental purposes, you can find the code [in a github gist](https://gist.github.com/jepler/95cd021e60b354f388298b573d725a69).

I've also tried reading and writing Apple II floppy images with a PC drive, contributing some pull requests to FluxEngine in the process ([1](https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine/pull/480), [2](https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine/pull/481)). However, a real Apple //e still can't reliably read the disk images I create.

**Kattni**

This week I did a bit of template work in both Arduino and CircuitPython. There are new templates for reading the LC709203 battery monitor on boards that have it, graphics test on board that have a built-in TFT, and using Adafruit IO to send and receive data.

I stumbled into a bug with `microcontroller.cpu.temperature` being called when WiFi is initiated, and went through a series of steps thinking I had fixed it, and it turns out, it's not something we can resolve. There's an issue filed on the ESP-IDF about the exact issue I was having, so it's at a lower level than CircuitPython. I filed an issue on the CircuitPython core so we have somewhere to link it to the IDF issue, and to track it.

**Melissa**

This past week I was out for part of the week due to health issues, but I did manage to get a little work done with updating Blinka to work with the Beaglebone Black on newer versions of the firmware. I also worked on preparing for a talk I gave this past weekend to the Dublin Linux Developers group.

**Tim**

I updated the PyPortal Winamp project to work with and fit nicely on the PyPortal Titano device. It also will now automatically generate a playlist by searching for mp3 files on the sdcard if the user didn't set up their playlist themselves.  I submitted a PR to CircuitPython core and nina-fw repositories to update the root certificates that are used when fetching data from the internet with CircuitPython. These allow us to fetch Webb Telescope data directly from a NASA provided server, so I updated that project to use the new data source and changed it to show the current data returned. 

I made a small update to some documentation of the wifi built-in module in the core. I also did some testing around and attempted to implement a solution to an issue occurring when sending USB HID events and updating large OnDiskBitmaps showing on the display.

**Scott**

This week I've been heads down on USB Host work. A week ago I decided that CircuitPython should provide a subset of the PyUSB API. This is the most commonly used CPython API used for interacting with USB devices. The benefit of copying the API is that we can port over existing code to CircuitPython as well. Making this decision got my brain unblocked.

The first platform I'm adding support for is the iMX RT (most popularly on the Teensy 4.x). The higher end versions of the iMX RT have two USB peripherals. One we can use for CIRCUITPY and one we can use for USB host. I've been getting code going there and revamping the serial debug setup a bit along the way.
