## Make: Reviews the Adafruit Feather RP2040 with DVI

[![Adafruit Feather RP2040 with DVI](../assets/20230627/20230627dvi.jpg)](https://makezine.com/products/boards/adafruit-feather-rp2040-with-dvi/)

The Make: Boards Guide reviews the Adafruit Feather RP2040 with DVI is a microcontroller board capable of DVI digital video output on an HDMI port. Since the RP2040's release, hackers have been pushing the PIO peripherals to their limits, including producing analog VGA video output. Taking it a step further, the PicoDVI project proved it was possible to generate digital video directly from the RP2040 without using an additional chip. Now Adafruit has packaged all the hardware needed to get DVI output from an RP2040 in a Feather-sized board and wrapped the PicoDVI project code for use in the Arduino IDE and in CircuitPython - [Makezine](https://makezine.com/products/boards/adafruit-feather-rp2040-with-dvi/) and [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5710).

## This Week's Python Streams

[![Python Streams](../assets/20230627/cccircuitpython.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

## Project of the Week: The PICOPAD

[![The PICOPAD](../assets/20230627/20230627pad.jpg)](https://pajenicko.cz/picopad-open-source-herni-konzole)

Picopad is an open game console that offers a unique opportunity for young tech enthusiasts. It comes as a kit, allowing one to learn the principles of soldering and electronics while building their own games console. In addition, Picopad supports C and MicroPython programming. It's based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller. It has a 2 inch TFT display and a microSD slot.

All games on Picopad are open source on [GitHub](https://pajenicko.cz/picopad-open-source-herni-konzole). A multi-program with 16 games is pre-installed on the Picopad, which provides a wide range of entertainment including Ants, Train, Flappy, PacMan, Sokoban, Atoms, Eggs, 15, GhostRace, Chess, Life, Maze, Raptor, Tetris, TV Tennis and Vegaslot. 

A novel thing for this is a UF2 SD card loader: from a menu, one can select to reflash/run games/programs in UF2 format, like a program loader for UF2 based software - [pajenicko.cz](https://pajenicko.cz/picopad-open-source-herni-konzole) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bobricius/status/1671966652701745174).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but there are some in processing.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230627/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **443**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I visited Adafruit in NYC last week. This week Scott, Jeff, and I triaged the remaining CircuitPython 8.2.0 issues. I addressed several of them, which were mostly just documentation improvements. Very soon we should be able to make an 8.2.0 release candidate, and if that works out, we'll release 8.2.0 final.

My [I2S BFF](https://learn.adafruit.com/i2s-amplifier-bff) guide went out this week. It has everything you need to know about your board, and includes examples in both Arduino and CircuitPython.

Next up is the Gamepad QT guide for the new I2C Mini Gamepad breakout. Keep an eye out for that, coming soon!

This past week, one of the bigger projects I completed was testing a large number of guides and  updating the [RGB Matrix Dreidel Game](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-matrix-dreidel-game) Learn Guide that Liz had written so that it could play I2S audio in addition to the original design. This involved updating the 3D design, building a circuit, and updating the software.

This week I've been working on testing the proposed changes to make ESP32SPI socket's API be more similar to it's CPYthon counterpart. MiniMQTT was the main functionality that I've tested with it this week. I also submitted a PR to refactor an older ESP32SPI_WSGI server module over to be in the WSGI library instead of the ESP32SPI Driver library and updated it to work with the newer, more compatible socket API.

For the Teddy Ruxpin (2017) reverse engineering project, I implemented mouth movements & eye movements. For mouth movements, I use the json output of a program called "rhubarb", which can turn an audio file into mouth positions; it was intended for cartoon animation but has proven useful here. A big thanks to John Park for investigating various pieces of software and concluding this one was the best open source one. My work is public and coded in Python but it's not yet documented well enough for anyone else to use: https://github.com/jepler/snxrom

Last week I was visiting New York City. We had high level discussions around Adafruit and CircuitPython but didn't work much on specific things. This week I revised [the swirly grid](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5774) [generator script](https://gist.github.com/tannewt/0acd1f6af48c43dc7e15243fe0af47ed) and then generated more sizes. Now, I'm working on USB host support including converting the USB reports from a connected keyboard into CircuitPython's serial input. This is the beginning of a "USB host workflow" where we can have an onboard text editor.

**Liz**

This week I published the guide for the new [RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-prop-maker-feather). I think this Feather will be really popular with folks since it has so many built-in components. I think the coolest part is the onboard I2S amp with the speaker terminal block output. Usually using I2S audio requires breadboarding or soldering so being able to quickly hook up a speaker and have nice sound quality is really cool.

I've also been updating some ESP32-S2/S3 guides to include information on the MAX17048 battery monitor, which is replacing the now-discontinued LC709203. This involves updating a few pages and redoing the Factory Reset code to check for either the LC709203 or the MAX17048.
