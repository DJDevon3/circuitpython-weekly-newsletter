## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220913/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm adding the ability to preserve the state of pins when entering deep sleep in CircuitPython. This will allow keeping devices powered up, maintaining static signaling on pins, and the like.

**Kattni**

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20220913/20220913melissa.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-web-workflow-using-the-code-editor)

This past week I wrote up a learn guide called [CircuitPython Web Workflow Code Editor Quick Start](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-web-workflow-using-the-code-editor). The guide covers getting most features on all the Web Workflow features I've added over the past couple of months. The guide includes a handy script I came up with to allow switching between multiple WiFi networks while USB Mass Storage is disabled.

**Tim**

This week I created FlipDigit and FlipClock widget classes that make use of pre-generated spritesheets to show an animated flip clock style transition from one number to another with displayio. The Digit represents a single number that can flip and change between the numbers 0-9. The FlipClock holds 4 digits, and draws a colon between them. To serve as the first test program using these widgets I used the NTP library to create a flip clock that stays in sync with the real time that it fetched from the server.
