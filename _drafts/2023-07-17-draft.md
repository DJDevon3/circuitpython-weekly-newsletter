## Coming Soon

[![Adafruit Matrix Portal S3](../assets/20230717/20230717-s3matrixportal.jpg)](url)

The Adafruit Matrix Portal S3 is an updated version that replaces the SAMD chip with an Espressif ESP32-S3.  The new Matrix Portal can do almost everything the original can.  The new S3 has a parallel output drive peripheral allowing it to control the matrix without bitbanging; has two cores allowing one to be dedicated to WiFi or matrix control while the other runs your code; and lots of memory: 8MB of Flash means plenty of space for code, files, GIFs, and more.  2MB of PSRAM means you can read lots of data and still have plenty of RAM for the matrix display buffers. - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5778).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there was 1 new board added!

- [Adafruit QT Py ESP32-S3 4MB Flash/2MB PSRAM](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_esp32s3_4mbflash_2mbpsram/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I spent most of my time on the MicroPython merge this week. We are merging changes relevant to CircuitPython from MicroPython v1.19.1, and then when that is done, we will merge v1.20, and v1.21 if it is released soon.

Deciding what code to merge can be difficult, because it is not obvious whether a code difference reflects new MicroPython code that should just replace the current code in CircuitPython, or whether the differences reflect changes made in CircutPython that should not be overridden. The origin of a piece of code can be tracked down, but it is tedious. I am thinking about marking our changes by adding "this was done for CircuitPython"-style comments. Then the origin of the code will clearer, and will be preserved and readily apparent when doing a future merge.

**Kattni**

This week I've been going through guide feedback. On each guide in the Adafruit Learn System, there is a "Feedback? Corrections?" link at the bottom of the left sidebar that allows you to submit feedback on the guide. These are aggregated for us so we can go through and update the guides as needed. It's been a bit since I went through it, so there were quite a few. I'm making excellent progress, and expect to finish it up next week.

**Melissa**

This past week I've been working on getting the TSC2046 touch screen controller working with the Raspberry Pi so that it can be used in place of a mouse. Adafruit's previous go-to resistive touchscreen chip, the STMPE610 and it's replacement the STMPE811 are no longer being produced or obtainable. This was to find a suitable replacement so the PiTFTs can be redesigned with chips that are available.

**Tim**

This week I wrote an Outlined Label class that can be used with upcoming changes within bitmaptools in the core to provide an easy way to make text with colored stroke outlines. I've also been working on changing over the ESP32SPI library and examples to use settings.toml instead of secrets.py and looking around at other library example and learn guide code to find other instances that can be changed over.

**Jeff**

I've been pitching in to help Scott with some of the USB Host project.

In particular, I've started adding support for non-US-QWERTY keyboards. With my current work in progress code, keyboards are still limited to ASCII, but alternate layouts can be used. I tested with a French AZERTY keyboard layout, which moves some characters around (such as swapping Q and A), places punctuation in unusual spots ({} are on top row keys with the Alt-Gr modifier) and also requires the shift key to enter numerals 0-9!

This was made much easier by the keyboard layout bundle from @Neradoc!

**Scott**

This week I've been primarily working on USB host. I've determined the two bigger issues to solve before moving on. The first is implementing sharing control of a device between TinyUSB class driver code and CircuitPython-level user code. pyusb has an API for detaching and attaching devices so we'll need to implement it fully.

The other issue is how to handle re-initializing the host port in code.py. With displays we have you call `displayio.release_displays()`. Since USB host doesn't have any settings, we'll silently return the same successful port a second time. The only trick with this is that changing pins of the port will require a reset.

**Liz**

This past week I published a guide for the new [Quad Rotary Encoder Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-quad-rotary-encoder-breakout). This is a seesaw-based board that lets you use four rotary encoders over I2C. Currently I'm working on a project that will use four of these boards for a total of 16 encoders.

I also wrote code for the very cute [Adabot Toy Robot Friend project](https://learn.adafruit.com/adabot-rp2040). If you've ever wanted an adorable Adabot desk companion, definitely check out that guide for an excellent 3D model of Adabot.

Finally, I also updated the [QT Py ESP32-S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-s3) for the new PSRAM version of the board. This involved some minor copy edits and creating UF2 and binary factory reset files.
