[![TalkPython podcast](../assets/20230814/20230814ps.jpg)](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/426/whats-new-in-pyscript-august-2023)

One of the most exciting initiatives in the Python space these days is PyScript, which enables Python running natively in a browser. With consistent support from the folks at Anaconda, this project has been making solid strides since its initial release. On the latest episode of TalkPython, host Michael Kennedy catches up with Fabio Pliger and Nicholas Tollervey to see where they are with the PyScript project. - [TalkPython](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/426/whats-new-in-pyscript-august-2023).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm continuing to work on merging MicroPython v1.19.1 into CircuitPython. After discussions with Scott,  I am removing, at least for now, the "long-lived" storage allocation enhancement from CircuitPython, which reduces heap fragmentation. It was increasingly incompatible with MicroPython's storage assumptions. I have some ideas about how to restore it in a more compatible way if it looks like we should put it back.

**Kattni**

This week I worked on the Metro RP2040 guide. This is a new board in the shop. The guide will have everything you need to get started with your new Metro. If you picked up one of these boards, keep an eye out for the guide coming soon!

I also resolved some guide feedback. The Feather ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT PrettyPins diagram had incorrect pins for I2C, the TFT, and NeoPixel power. The diagrams are generated from preexisting data; they are not manually created. When I reran the script to see if it would give me the correct information, it worked perfectly. So, I have no idea why it produced incorrect info on the first round, as I can't replicate the issue. We're all perplexed. Regardless, the version available in the guide and on GitHub is now correct. 

**Melissa**

This past week, I focused on improving graphics in CircuitPython. To begin with, I added support for 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit uncompressed bitmap loading to the [Adafruit_CircuitPython_ImageLoad](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ImageLoad) library. 

After that, I worked on the core and updated the `alphablend` function to support multiple blend modes as well as a `skip` index parameter, which allows masking parts of images when blending, which is important since alpha transparencies are not supported in CircuitPython. 

I also created another PR for the `Imageload` library to add support for bitfield compressed images, which is the format that GIMP exports bitmaps. At this time, neither the `alphablend` nor `Imageload` PRs have been merged, but hopefully they will be soon.

All of this graphics work was to improve the performance of a message board project I am currently working on. I was able to combine all of this code along with some double buffering to get some smooth animations on the MatrixPortal S3.

**Tim**

This week I worked on submitting some requests to OSHWA for certification and showing Kattni the process for submitting them. I've also been continuing to work through library PRs, most of the testing this week was around new capabilities added to the `ImageLoad` library. 

**Jeff**

A couple of weeks ago I ordered several ESP32-S3 boards from Tindie, because these boards support what are sometimes called "dot clock" displays. These displays have to be continually refreshed with the display data (they don't contain a framebuffer themselves), and the S3 has a peripheral just for this purpose. If it works out, accessing this kind of display can be more efficient than SPI or I2C displays, though it uses a lot of pins.

Community member kmatch98 previously implemented this, but with some limitations that meant it wasn't suitable for including in mainline CircuitPython. I'm hoping that with the benefit of that code as well as changes to CircuitPython in the meantime, it'll be possible to land a version of this in the core in the coming weeks, for CircuitPython 9.

I'll be on a couple of the CircuitPython Day live streams this week! Check out the list of events elsewhere in the newsletter and join us if it sounds interesting to you.

**Scott**

Last week, I published the [USB_Host_Descriptors](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_USB_Host_Descriptors) and [USB_Host_Mass_Storage](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_USB_Host_Mass_Storage/) libraries. Together they enable mounting USB drives from within CircuitPython. Afterward, you can read and write files to the drive.

The start of this week, I've fallen down the CPU trace rabbit hole since I got my [Orb Trace Mini](https://orbcode.org/orbtrace-mini/). Using it I'm able to debug via [blackmagic](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic) as well. However, I had to add 1011 detection and support. It only supported the 1060 previously.

**Liz**

This week, Noe Ruiz and I were guests on the [Hackster Cafe livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV7dRsMhHsk). We chatted about the recent projects we've done with the new [RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5768): [Adabot](https://learn.adafruit.com/adabot-rp2040) and the [RP2040 Lightsaber](https://learn.adafruit.com/lightsaber-rp2040). We also talked about some general project tips and CircuitPython tricks we've utilized.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever!

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20230814/20230814weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)
