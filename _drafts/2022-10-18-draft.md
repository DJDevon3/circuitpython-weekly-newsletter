## Espressif Developer Conference 2022 This Week With Ladyada

[![Espressif DevCon22](../assets/20221018/20221018esp.jpg)](https://devcon.espressif.com/#program)

Espressif DevCon22 is the first official for Espressif developers. This two-day online conference October 19-20 will bring to you content about products and solutions created by Espressif and its partners. You can expect over 30 talks on topics including Matter, RainMaker, ESP-IDF, Privilege Separation, Embedded Rust, Components Manager, Board Support Packages, 3rd-party frameworks, and more - [Espressif](https://devcon.espressif.com/#program).

[![Espressif DevCon22 - Ladyada](../assets/20221018/20221018esp2.jpg)](https://devcon.espressif.com/#program)

Limor "Ladyada" Fried of Adafruit will speak about CircuitPython on ESP32 at 1900 Central European Time on October 19th - [Espressif](https://devcon.espressif.com/#program).

## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 2 Released!

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 2 Released](../assets/20221018/20221018cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/13/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-2-released/)

CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.2 was released! It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/13/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-2-released/).

**Warning: The flash partitioning for the Raspberry Pi Pico W has changed since 8.0.0-beta.1. When you load 8.0.0-beta.2 over beta.1 (or vice versa), on the Pico W only, CIRCUITPY will be erased and reformatted.**

Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0

* Added WiFi workflow with browser-based device discovery, filesystem browsing, upload, download, file editing, serial/REPL connection.
* Added a one-line status bar, which displays connection status, last exception, and version on a terminal window title or on the top line of an attached display. Support for status bar display is also being added to the Mu and Thonny editors.
* `.env` file in CIRCUITPY specifies WiFi connection parameters, BLE name, and other startup values.
* `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values are set by values in `.env` file. Values can be fetched from other `dotenv`-format files.
* WiFi functionality implemented on the Pi Pico W.
* Revised Espressif camera support, now available on ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3.
* Bulk analog input: `analogbufio` (available only on RP2040 for now).
* Pin state can be preserved during deep sleep (available only on Espressif for now).
* Allow setting USB VID, PID, manufacturer, and product ids at runtime.
* Enabled `collections.deque` on most builds.
* `MP3Decoder` and `WaveFile` can now take a filename instead of an open file.
* `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
* In-place firmware update (`dualbank`) capability may be disabled in favor of a larger CIRCUITPY drive.
* Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
* Added `os.utime()`.

## Join the Python Developers Survey 2022: Share and learn about the community

[![Python Developers Survey 2022](../assets/20221018/20221018psf.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/10/join-python-developers-survey-2022.html)

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is conducting the sixth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it. The PSF encourages you to contribute to our community’s knowledge. [The survey](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/10/join-python-developers-survey-2022.html) should only take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. After the survey is over, the PSF will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local equivalent - [PSF](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/10/join-python-developers-survey-2022.html).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221018/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.2 on October 13. It has much more complete Pico W WiFi support, courtesy Jeff, including SSL. There are also many other fixes and additions.

By upgrading to a newer version of the ESP-IDF, I was able to fix a couple of problems in the Espressif WiFi code, including a crash and a scanning problem. Unfortunately, this version does not yet fix the ESP32-S3 I2C problems we are seeing.

I am still chipping away at the remaining issues for the 8.0.0 final release.

**Kattni**

This past week I worked on updating the Running [TensorFlow Lite Object Recognition on the Raspberry Pi 4](https://learn.adafruit.com/running-tensorflow-lite-on-the-raspberry-pi-4) guide so that it can now be used with the latest Bullseye release. This involved a lot of trial and error to find what settings played nicest together.

**Tim**

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a guide to import the [CLUE Custom Badge project into PyLeap](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyleap-clue-custom-conference-badge). Since folks will be using PyLeap for this project, I included instructions on editing the code with the File Glider app to customize the badge. This is a great way for folks to use and edit CircuitPython projects without a computer.

I also updated the [Arduino to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-to-circuitpython) guide. There was some guide feedback relating to updates that have occurred with CircuitPython over the last few releases so everything should be up to date now.

## Upcoming events!
