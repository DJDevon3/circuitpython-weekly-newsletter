Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Finally, a week without a new CircuitPython release. Don't hold your breath too long as there will be an 8.0.4 and 8.1.0 is progressing. Today is a favorite of folks in science, math and computers+microcontrollers - it's Pi Day (3/14 in date/day format). Feel free to post your favorite Raspberry Pi-based project on social media and let us know via cpnews(at)adafruit(dot)com if it's programmed in any flavor of Python. I hope you enjoy this issue - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Happy Pi Day

[![Pi Day](../assets/20230314/20230314piday.jpg)](https://www.piday.org/)

Pi Day is celebrated on March 14th (3/14) around the world. Pi (Greek letter “π”) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159. Pi Day is an annual opportunity for math enthusiasts to recite the infinite digits of Pi, talk to their friends about math, and eat pie - [piday.org](https://www.piday.org/).

Pi Day is also a day of celebrating Raspberry Pi. Pull out your favorite Pi (a Pi Pico / PicoW count!) and have some fun and consider donating to the Raspberry Pi Foundation - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RaspberryPi_org/status/1633769903155994624) and [Donate](https://www.raspberrypi.org/donate/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=pi-day-2023).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230314/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **360**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This week I'm collecting a small number of fixes for a CircuitPython 8.0.4 release, which should happen fairly soon. I've also updated several underlying software libraries used by CircuitPython, in preparation for the 8.1.0 release.

**Melissa**

I was out sick most of this past week, but was able to work with the Adafruit IO team to resolve an elusive issue where the ESP8266 was freezing up. It ended up being due to an incorrect file system size parameter. I also started trying out the new ChatGPT API on the Raspberry Pi to see what some of the possibilities are.

**Tim**

I have been on vacation a portion of the week. Before leaving I was working on trying to fix some bugs in the bitmaptools boundary fill method. It was not properly executing background tasks or checking for interrupt from user so it made it feel stalled while working on larger bitmap segments.

**Jeff**

I've been working on the next feature for the Metro M7 (i2s output) and a ChatGPT-powered game for PyPortal that presents an infinite text adventure game. For the latter, there was a short video shown on last week's Ask an Engineer about it. It'll soon be a guide in the Adafruit Learning System.

**Scott**

This week I've been exploring the world of iMX RT's memory hierarchy and its impact on error handling and performance. These cpu cores have caches and tightly coupled memory that can be used to store data and code for fast access. Without using this areas well, the CPU will spend time waiting and effectively slow down.

Furthermore, if we're writing flash for CIRCUITPY, we cannot access code on the flash at the same time. This lead to really bad crashes where the CPU couldn't load the error handling code. Putting error handling code in RAM makes the crashes easier to debug and enter safe mode from.

So, I hope to make a PR soon to improve error handling and also performance.

This past week I published two new product guides. The first was for the [ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s3-reverse-tft-feather). It's really great for compact IoT projects since it has the screen and three buttons built-in. The next guide was the [PiCowbell Adalogger](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-picowbell-adalogger-for-pico). This board is designed to plug directly into a Pico or Pico W and has a STEMMA QT port, microSD card slot and RTC module with a coin cell battery holder for battery back-up. In the CircuitPython and Arduino pages I included examples for setting the RTC and for a quick start datalogging example: logging data from a temperature sensor to a text file on the microSD card with timestamps from the RTC.
