## Two New Versions of CircuitPython Released

[![Two New Versions of CircuitPython](../assets/20230404/20230404cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/30/circuitpython-8-1-0-beta-1-released/)

There were two releases of CircuitPython at the end of last week: one to the stable version (8.0.5) and one to the latest beta version (8.1.0-beta.1):

The stable version of the 8.0 branch was updated to fix known bugs - [8.0.5](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/30/circuitpython-8-0-5-released/) and [release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.0.5).

The latest beta version fixes bugs for the proposed version 8.1.0 and adds some nice new capabilities - [8.1.0-beta.1](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/30/circuitpython-8-1-0-beta-1-released/) and [release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.1.0-beta.1).

**Notable changes to 8.1.0 since 8.0.0**
* Add animated GIF support: `gifio.OnDiskGif`.
* Add `safemode.py`, for programmatic handling of safe mode.
* Add 7-color e-ink display support.
* Allow setting pystack size in `settings.toml`.
* Add dither support to `Palette`.
* Support `array.extend(iterable)`.
* Add `bitmaptools.drawpolygon()`.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230404/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **414**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made releases of both CircuitPython 8.0.5 and 8.1.0-beta.1 on March 30. 8.0.5 contains one bug fix, courtesy of Jeff: editing settings.toml could have caused a restart loop. 8.1.0-beta.1 contains many enhancements and fixes. There are only 11 issues left for 8.1.0.

This week I added a fix, included in beta.1, that handles "raw HID" reports from the host properly. Raw HID is sometimes used for simple custom data transfer between a host and a USB device.

**Kattni**

This week I finished up the Adafruit Feather RP2040 DVI guide, as well as the Adafruit Feather RP2040 RFM69 and RFM95 guides. All of these, if they are not already out, will definitely be out soon. Keep an eye out if you're interested! 

I added the Adafruit Feather RP2040 RFM board definition to CircuitPython which is necessary to use any microcontroller board with CircuitPython. It was nice to step into the core again, if only for a bit.

I will soon be documenting a few projects I've been working on including a grow light using Adafruit DotStars, and a time lapse photography project using the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera. There will be guides for both. I'll keep everyone posted here on the progress.

**Melissa**

This past week, I have been working on writing a guide for the ChatGPT Robotic Bear that I mentioned last week. It should be published soon, so look for it under [New Guides on the Adafruit Learn System](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest). This guide required a lot of photos because the modification steps were a bit more intricate than previous guides I have worked on.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on testing and capturing network traffic logs related to some proposed changes in the ethernet library. I also looked into an issue with the docs pages that were resulting in some of the interactive capabilities not working properly when viewed on docs.circuitpython.org and submitted a fix that restored the functionality.

It was an eventful week!

I published a new guide, "Generating Text with ChatGPT, Pico W & CircuitPython", that shows how to generate text using OpenAI's API and stream the results to an OLED display, all using the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

I fixed some bugs in CircuitPython, including a vexing one that could leave your board in a hard-to-rescue state if you created a large settings.toml file.

And last but not least, I implemented PWMAudioOut for the Metro M7 (and presumably other mimxrt10xx based boards), and fixed a bug affecting both I2SOut and PWMAudioOut on the Metro M7 that caused the audio sample rate to not be honored in all cases, causing audio to be played out of tune and too fast.

This week I worked on two product guides for CAN Bus: the [CAN Bus FeatherWing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-can-bus-featherwing) and the [CAN Pal](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-can-pal). The FeatherWing has an MCP2515 so you can use it with a Feather dev board that does not have a native CAN peripheral. The CAN Pal works with boards that have a native CAN peripheral. I had never worked with CAN Bus before, so it was fun to learn something new with both of these guides.
