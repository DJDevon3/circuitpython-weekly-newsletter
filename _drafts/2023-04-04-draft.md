## Two New Versions of CircuitPython Released

[![Two New Versions of CircuitPython](../assets/20230404/20230404cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/30/circuitpython-8-1-0-beta-1-released/)

There were two releases of CircuitPython at the end of last week: one to the stable version (8.0.5) and one to the latest beta version (8.1.0-beta.1):

The stable version of the 8.0 branch was updated to fix known bugs - [8.0.5](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/30/circuitpython-8-0-5-released/) and [release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.0.5).

The latest beta version fixes bugs for the proposed version 8.1.0 and adds some nice new capabilities - [8.1.0-beta.1](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/03/30/circuitpython-8-1-0-beta-1-released/) and [release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.1.0-beta.1).

**Notable changes to 8.1.0 since 8.0.0**
* Add animated GIF support: `gifio.OnDiskGif`.
* Add `safemode.py`, for programmatic handling of safe mode.
* Add 7-color e-ink display support.
* Allow setting pystack size in `settings.toml`.
* Add dither support to `Palette`.
* Support `array.extend(iterable)`.
* Add `bitmaptools.drawpolygon()`.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230404/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **414**!
