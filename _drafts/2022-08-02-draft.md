## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220802/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **360**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This past week I debugged some ESP32SPI-related problems, which were due to MQTT timeouts and not handling certain exceptions. I revised a number of Learn Guide projects to fix these potential issues.

I've now gone back to working on the ESP32 port, and am currently debugging builds for boards with no PSRAM available.

**Kattni**

This was another short week for me. I focussed on getting the final WipperSnapper pages completed. Other than that, I finished up a bunch of miscellaneous items I had hanging around or recently assigned.

In CircuitPython Day news, I'm continuing to add more content. Next week I'll be spending more time on planning, and I'm hoping to have a tentative schedule available soon! Keep an eye on it [here](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/07/27/announcing-circuitpython-day-2022-on-august-19th-circuitpythonday2022-circuitpython-python-copy-copy/).

**Melissa**

This past week, I've spent most of my time working on refactoring [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org) in order to accommodate additional workflows. Part of it was re-familiarizing myself with the existing code and then coming up with a plan about how it should work and the steps I needed to get there. Once that was figured out, the refactoring itself was relatively quick. While the interface is still almost exactly the same at this point, the underlying code structure is now quite a bit better and more loosely coupled.

**Tim**

This week I continued working on the Octopus game guide and adding comments to the code for it. I believe the game is now set save for some smaller details like potentially highscore saving. I've also still been working on the Hack Tablet build of CircuitPython that is adding dot clock display support for displayio. The giveaway for these tablets was officially announced this week and entry form is available now for those that wish to enter for a chance to receive one. 

**Scott**

This week I've been improving the web workflow. I've just about finished adding dynamic reconfig and changing the port. I improved the responsiveness of the workflow so that it responds as other code is running. I've tweaked the C3's serial transmit code to improve reliability. Currently, I'm reworking the status title bar code so that it is only transmitted as needed and therefore, speed everything up.

**Liz**

This week I wrapped up the [IoT Pet Food Scale](https://learn.adafruit.com/iot-food-scale-with-azure-and-circuitpython) using CircuitPython with Microsoft Azure. I also made a [1-minute video](https://youtube.com/shorts/w9GubS0aSl8) about the project featuring one of the benefactors of the project: my cat Winnie.

I also worked on documenting the new 9-DoF sensor in the shop: the [LSM6DS3TR-C + LIS3MDL Stemma Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5543). I wrote up a [standalone guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lsm6ds3tr-c-lis3mdl-precision-9-dof-imu) for it, added it to the [ST 9-DoF Combo Breakouts guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/st-9-dof-combo) and went through the [How to Fuse Motion Sensor Data into AHRS Orientation guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-fuse-motion-sensor-data-into-ahrs-orientation-euler-quaternions) to make sure magnetometer calibration was working as expected.
