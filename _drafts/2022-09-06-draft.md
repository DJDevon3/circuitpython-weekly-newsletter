## CircuitPython 7.3.3 is Released

[![CircuitPython 7.3.3 is Released](../assets/20220906/20220906cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/29/circuitpython-7-3-3-released/)

CircuitPython 7.3.3 IS the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython and is a new stable release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/29/circuitpython-7-3-3-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/7.3.3).

**Notable changes to 7.3.3 since 7.3.2**

* Adafruit MatrixPortal: Turn off `ulab` to allow freezing `adafruit_portalbase`, to create more available RAM.
* Return `None` from `usb_hid.get_last_received_report()` when no report is available or the last report has already been read.
* Don’t reload or enter REPL when autoreloading.
* Fix `\_bleio.PacketBuffer` handling of fixed-length characteristics.
* Update frozen libraries.
* Build macOS `mpy-cross` executables with macOS 11.

Download from circuitpython.org: Firmware downloads are available from the [downloads page](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) on [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/). The site makes it easy to select the correct file and language for your board.

## Adafruit Adding CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W

[![CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20220906/20220906picow.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/30/raspberry-pi-pico-w-circuitpython-blink/)

The firmware UF2 for the Raspberry Pi Pico W LOOKS simple enough... on boot it blinks the onboard LED 3 times and then boots into CircuitPython 8. But, looks can be deceiving! The LED on the Pico W is not connected to a GPIO on the RP2040. It’s connected to a GPIO on the WiFi/BLE module! That blinking means that the bootloader is able to load firmware and communicate with the module in the CircuitPython firmware, an important first step to implementing the rest of the wireless stack. Soon, CircuitPython and the hundreds of libraries and IoT examples will be ready to run on the Pico W - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/30/raspberry-pi-pico-w-circuitpython-blink/), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Y7ylUu6esIY) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1564424605602922496).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220906/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I implemented the ability to turn the CircuitPython status bar on and off, in case it might be found to be interfering with something else, or the user did not want to be present. We were having trouble with the Thonny editor and the status bar, when there were errors present. But this might have been due to an existing bug that was not really related to the status bar but was exercised by it.

I also spent time determining why deep sleep on certain ESP32 boards was using more power than expected in some situations. It appears to be due to not shutting down some power-control pins.

**Kattni**

This week I've been working with CircuitPython on the ESP32 V2 Feather. I'm working on a guide to build a WiFi mailbox notifier. The reason the project was switched to WiFi was to simplify the build, and give me a chance to work with the ESP32 CircuitPython workflow and the new web workflow. I've already found a couple of bugs.

 I also created a new template showing how to install CircuitPython on ESP32 boards - we have explanations in multiple places, but not a board-specific version of it for each board guide.

**Melissa**

This past week I made a lot of progress with adding Web Workflow features to [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org). I finished adding Device Discovery and made the workflow much smoother. One of the things I'm particularly proud of is adding functionality to be able to transfer your work between different URLs. This solves one of the big problems with users starting work in one place and realizing they needed to save the work on a different device. 

Originally we had planned to have everything happen on code.circuitpython.org, but browser security made this difficult and while the workaround of loading the website from the device worked, it made other things more challenging. However, this removes one of the largest remaining obstacles.

**Tim**

I updated the mpy size measurement PR based on feedback received. I tested and reviewed several library PRs including one for an alternative mode of operation for LSM303 accelerometers. I also worked on PIL based scripts to generate number sprites and create animation frames representing the top and bottom half of the numbers flipping down. I've have gotten it worked out so the number of animation frames can be specified so that we can try a few variations to find a good balance between having a smooth animation, and keeping the spritesheets as small as possible to preserve file storage space and memory. 

**Liz**

This week I worked on something that was not CircuitPython related: [a guide showing how to use Unity with Arduino and a 9 DoF sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/controlling-objects-in-unity-with-arduino). It would be cool to maybe revisit at some point with CircuitPython. However, in my research for the project, integrating Arduino and Unity seems to be a common question without a lot of written examples and code so I'm excited to have this resource available for folks.

I also worked on a new product guide for the [MAX17048 Battery Monitor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-max17048-lipoly-liion-fuel-gauge-and-battery-monitor). That guide does include CircuitPython. I'm out on vacation next week, but I'm brainstorming a few projects at the moment that I'll be working on when I return.
