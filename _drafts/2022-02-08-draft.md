## A CircuitPython Pull Request to Add Split Screen Capabilities

[![Split Screen](../assets/20220208/20220208split.gif)](https://twitter.com/CycleMatch/status/1488370312492326918?s=20&t=n-MDQEFS8XHUjtxEpAiVxQ)

[![Split Screen](../assets/20220208/20220208split.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/5954#issuecomment-1028431918)

kmatch98 has a new PR in (#5954) that exposes the CircuitPython REPL's display group elements, allowing relocation of the REPL and making thinks like split screens possible without breaking the existing displayio structure - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CycleMatch/status/1488370312492326918?s=20&t=n-MDQEFS8XHUjtxEpAiVxQ) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/5954).

## Piku: a small command line utility for managing CircuitPython projects

Piku is small command line utility for managing CircuitPython projects. With Pikuyou can make creating a CircuitPython project, installing packages, deploying, and connecting to a CircuitPython device easy to do from the command line - [Adafruit Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=188036), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/piku/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mraleson/piku).

> I am sure there are other tools out there but I tried to pattern piku after other package management tools i had used like poetry and npm. The tool makes it easier to create a project, add modules from the official and community bundles, deploy the project to the device, and connect to the device's serial port. I hope that in the future it will have similar functionality to other similar tools like poetry and npm. I have tested it lightly and it seems to work on Ubuntu and Windows and it may work on macOS (I don't have one to test on).<br> <br>Piku can be installed using pip. I only have a few devices to test on, but it has really helped me iterate faster on my personal project. I hope it is helpful to someone else who likes a command like workflow like me. I would also love help improving it if anyone feels so inclined. You can check the docs on pypi or github. Feedback welcome.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220208/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **344**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_AzureIoT](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AzureIoT)
 * [CircuitPython_Community_Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle)
