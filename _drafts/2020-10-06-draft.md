[![Python Developers Survey 2020](../assets/20201005/20201005psf.jpg)](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/10/join-python-developers-survey-2020.html)

This year, the Python Software Foundation is conducting the fourth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it.

In 2019, more than 24,000 Python users from 150 countries participated and shared how they use the language.

Contribute to the community’s knowledge. The survey takes about 10 minutes to complete - [Python Blog](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/10/join-python-developers-survey-2020.html).

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

I just wrapped up my work on the [CircuitPython library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP2515) for the MCP2515 CANbus controller. It was fun to work with and I enjoyed collaborating with Jeff to determine the API that the `canio` devices will use. This work will make it so that code written for one CAN controller, like those included with the SAM-E51 will be usable with another CAN controller, such as the venerable MCP2515.

Next up, I’m working on a sweet little 12-bit ADC, the TLA2024, before looping back to do some additional real-world tests with the CAN hardware and libraries.

**Kattni**

I'm back after being out for two weeks, so there's not much to report this week. Published a guide for the QT Py. Many of these were purchased before the guide was written, so if you got your QT Py, but aren't sure where to begin, check out the guide to get started. I updated the guide for the TSL2591 to include the STEMMA QT version. I wrote up a quick guide for the LTC4311 with pinouts and downloads resources. I'm now working on a guide for the MIDI FeatherWing, so keep an eye out for that.

**Lucian**

**Melissa**

This past week I've been quite busy. It started off with writing a [guide for the new MatrixPortal board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4), which turned out quite well.

[![Melissa](../assets/20201005/20201005melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I finished up the Python version of the PiTFT installer script and learned enough of the Click library to add some automation flags so that the script could be completely automated with a single command and no other user input. For complex installations with boards like the new BrainCraft Hat, this makes a huge difference. One of the big advantages of this is that we can customize the install command for each display and the user can run it without worrying about selecting the wrong options.

[![Melissa](../assets/20201005/20201005melissa1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Finally, the Jetson Nano has been updated to include easily enabling SPI since I wrote a guide for it. So I went through and did a refresh of the guide to make it so it is up to date including how to enable SPI. I also [added a page on SPI](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-libraries-on-linux-and-the-nvidia-jetson-nano) including TFT usage and using NeoPixels with SPI. With the recent improvements, this is now one of my favorite boards that supports Blinka.

**Scott**

Since last week, I've finished fixing Requests for now. Seems to recover from errors well enough. Plus, I burnt myself out a bit on working on networking so a break is welcome.

Later last week I continued to polish up UF2 for the ESP32-S2. I got release assets attached to releases. The last thing I need to do is write up a guide on how to add UF2 support to new boards and install it on them.

Most of this week though has been fixing software issues for two new Metros for two different platforms. Metros are the best form factor to start with because they have the debug connection for easy debugging. I'm excited to see new boards coming!
