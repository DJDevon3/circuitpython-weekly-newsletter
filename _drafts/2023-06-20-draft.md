## Bluetooth Arrives for the Raspberry Pi Pico W

[![Bluetooth Arrives for the Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20230620/20230620picow.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-functionality-bluetooth-for-pico-w/)

A year after the Raspberry Pi Pico W was launched with its Infineon CYW43439 wireless chip, Raspberry Pi has software to enable Bluetooth for their C SDK (Version 1.5.1) and in MicroPython. CircuitPython support will follow in time - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-functionality-bluetooth-for-pico-w/) and [hackster.io](https://twitter.com/Hacksterio/status/1668954939349950466).

> "Specifically, we support Bluetooth Classic — with the temporary exception of ACL/SCO — along with both the BLE Central and Peripheral roles. Things are also configurable so you can enable Bluetooth Classic and BLE either individually, or have both of them available at the same time."

## Project of the Week: Track Flights in Real-Time on a PyPortal

[![Track flights in Real-Time on a PyPortal](../assets/20230620/20230620flight.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/06/14/track-flights-in-real-time-on-a-pyportal-circuitpython-pyportal/)

The Flight Tracker collects and visualizes real-time flight data on an Adafruit PyPortal display, enabling users to track and monitor the live positions of aircraft through a dynamically updating map, controlled via CircuitPython.

To begin, a custom map image is downloaded to the PyPortal, centered on a location coordinate defined by the user. This image serves as the background for the map display. Then, at regular intervals of thirty seconds, the Flight Tracker sends a request to the OpenSky Network API, retrieving live aircraft data that falls within the boundaries of the map - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/06/14/track-flights-in-real-time-on-a-pyportal-circuitpython-pyportal/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adafruit/comments/148ey6x/track_flights_in_realtime_on_a_pyportal_tutorial/), [Tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/rhammell/pyportal-flight-tracker-0be6b0) and [GitHub](https://github.com/rhammell/pyportal-flight-tracker).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added (after some weeks with a bunch).

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230620/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've started merging MicroPython v1.19.1 into CircuitPython. I'm examining several hundred changed, added, or deleted files. So far there are no surprises.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [NeoKey Breakouts guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/neokey-breakout) and the [TRRS jack breakout guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/trrs-jack-breakout). The NeoKey guide has everything you need to use both the MX and CHOC NeoKey Breakouts, including demos. The TRRS jack breakout guide gives you details about the board.

Next up, I'm working on the guide for the I2S Amplifier BFF. This guide will have everything you need to know about the BFF. It will also have multiple demos in CircuitPython and Arduino to get you started with I2S audio. Keep an eye out for that!

**Melissa**

This past week, I've been testing out all of the Matrix-related guides to ensure that they are working with upcoming hardware. Some of the testing failed and I'm going through those guides and fixing the code to get it working.

**Tim**

This week I've continued to dig into the core hidden tilegird issue and have learned more about the internal variables inside of TileGrid implementation. I have a proposed change to try to fix the reported issue that I will submit the PR for this week. 

I've also picked up the effort to effort to refactor the ESP32SPI socket to have the same API as CPYthon and builtin wifi sockets. Danh originally worked on this, but there was an incompatibility found when using the refactored version to download large files. I found the root cause of the incompatibility and submitted a PR for a fix in the requests library and I'll be carrying out further testing based on feedback from discussion during the weekly meeting.

**Jeff**

[![CP/M](../assets/20230620/20230620jeff.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/rp2040-runcpm-emulator-with-usb-keyboard-hdmi-screen)

My main activity in the last week was not CircuitPython: I published a new guide showing how to create a full-fledged CP/M retrocomputer using a couple of Adafruit Feather boards. You can [check it out on the Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/rp2040-runcpm-emulator-with-usb-keyboard-hdmi-screen) and [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/jeff-epler-turns-two-adafruit-feather-rp2040-boards-into-a-fully-functional-cp-m-microcomputer-ee2a95b123dc).

**Scott**

This week I'm traveling. So, I'm not getting many coding projects done. I am having lots of good CircuitPython discussions and have gotten a swirly mounting board. It looks like it turned out ok. I'm still caught up on email, Discord and the forums too.

**Liz**

This week I did a few guide updates. I updated the Pico W HTTP Server code to work with the new http server library refactor. I also did some updates on the ESP32-S3 board guides to include text in the Arduino pages for pressing the reset button after uploading code to the board. Otherwise I've been getting the RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather guide started and I've been documenting a new project that involves adding a QT Py ESP32-S2 to an Ikea air quality monitor.

## Call for help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever!

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20230620/20230620weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
