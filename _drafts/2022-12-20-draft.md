Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter!  - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Issue Uploading UF2 files with macOS 13.0 Ventura Fixed in Version 13.1

[![Uploading UF2 files with macOS](../assets/20221220/20221220uf2.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/)

Uploading UF2 file issues with macOS 13.0 Ventura have been fixed in Version 13.1. Not all is perfect, though. It is still the case that UF2 uploading does not work on nRF52840 boards that use an older UF2 bootloader (versions 0.6.2 and newer work). On those boards, the bootloader appears to fail quickly. Copying a UF2 file does not work, which is indicated by the UF2 filename appearing in the BOOT drive. The bootloader can be updated by following the directions [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/blob/master/README.md#flash). Otherwise, on these nRF52840 boards, including the Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit, the Feather nRF52840, and the ItsyBitsy nRF52840, the only way to load a UF2 file is to use a non-Ventura computer.

It is also still true that copying .hex files larger than 1MB does not work (e.g., on the micro:bit). See https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink/issues/982 for workarounds and further investigation - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ventura-problem/).

## New 3D Printing Model Website: Printables

[![Printables](../assets/20221220/20221220print.jpg)](https://blog.prusa3d.com/starting-a-3d-printing-revolution-introducing-official-brand-profiles-on-printables-com_73408/)

For better or worse, many of the 3D printable cases, parts and more have been placed on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/), controlled by MakerBot. A new model aggregator has emerged with content backinng from prominent content creators including Adafruit: Printables by Prusa  - [Prusa](https://blog.prusa3d.com/starting-a-3d-printing-revolution-introducing-official-brand-profiles-on-printables-com_73408/).

> Wouldn’t it be great, if you could download official 3D printable files with replacement parts and accessories for your home appliances? Or an official fan model from your favorite game? Today, with our partners from various industries, we’re turning this into reality and starting a revolution in how big brands approach 3D printing!  All 3D models shared on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/) are available for free, allowing anyone to easily download and print them at home. This opens up a world of possibilities for businesses and consumers alike. Some replacement parts can be printed locally and on-demand, eliminating the need for inventory and shipping. This also makes it easier for brands to support the right-to-repair initiative. In addition to replacement parts, businesses can also create accessories and mods for their products. This allows consumers to personalize and improve their products, making them even more valuable and unique. And for fans of popular games and movies, brands can create official fan models, such as figures, costumes, and props.

## RISC-V: The background, the benefits, and the future

[![RISC-V: The background, the benefits, and the future](../assets/20221220/20221220r5.jpg)](https://www.eeworldonline.com/risc-v-background-benefits-and-future-faq/)

US developers conceived the revolutionary instruction set architecture (ISA) known as RISC-V in 2010. Grounded in reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles, it’s a common, open-source, and completely free ISA that can be used to develop software and hardware. These attributes are just part of what makes the architecture unique and attractive to developers and manufacturers.

While it’s far from new, momentum around RISC-V is continuing to accelerate, with various services, technologies, and products that leverage this architecture emerging in the past year alone. According to Deloitte, use of RISC-V’s open-chip processors was expected to double this year and is set to double again in 2023 - [EEWorld](https://www.eeworldonline.com/risc-v-background-benefits-and-future-faq/).

## What We Can Learn From Vintage Computing

[![What We Can Learn From Vintage Computing](../assets/20221220/20221220vintage.jpg)](https://github.com/readme/featured/vintage-computing)

Thanks to open source, no technology ever has to become obsolete, so long as a community remains to support it. You can sync Newtons and Palm Pilots with modern desktops, download web browsers for long-discontinued operating systems, [replace a 6502 with a Teensy](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/14/a-teensy-4-1-powered-drop-in-upgrade-for-commodore-64-vintagecomputing/), or connect vintage computers like the Apple IIe to the modern internet via WiFi. Every year, new cartridges are released for old-school video game consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy - [The ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme/featured/vintage-computing).

## Project of the Week: A Runner's Headlight

[![Runner's Headlight](../assets/20221220/20221220run.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmKbKJCKh0v/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY%3D)

The Metanerd Headlight Mk. 2

> The Mk. 1 was a success in the sense that it was made entirely from leftover parts from unrelated earlier projects, but I wasn't really satisfied with the design.
Particularly the area around the two close range LEDs bothered me and I also felt like it could be a little more compact.<br>&nbsp; <br>Enter Mk. 2. Not only is it physically smaller and uses less power, it also looks much more professionally designed. It has the same control and the same mix of close and long range lights. Close range: 2 x 1W with 90 deg lens and angled down 15 degrees to illuminate the ground immediately in front of and around me. Long range: 1 x 3W with 5 degree lens for a focused cone of light so I can see far ahead.
