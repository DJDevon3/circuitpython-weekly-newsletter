## Raspberry Pi is Supporting KiCad Open Source Design Automation Software

[![Raspberry Pi is Supporting KiCad](../assets/20221220/20221220kicad.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supporting-kicad-open-source-design-automation-software/)

Raspberry Pi Ltd is helping KiCad with their end-of-year funding drive by matching donations made on [KiCad’s website](http://www.kicad.org/) up to $5000 - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supporting-kicad-open-source-design-automation-software/).

>... We use it for some of our product designs. Dominic developed the [Compute Module 4 IO board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board/) using KiCad, and the design database is free for anyone to download and use as a starting point for their own CM4 projects: you can download a zip file of the database [here](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm4io/CM4IO-KiCAD.zip).

## RISC-V: The background, the benefits, and the future

[![RISC-V: The background, the benefits, and the future](../assets/20221220/20221220r5.jpg)](https://www.eeworldonline.com/risc-v-background-benefits-and-future-faq/)

US developers conceived the revolutionary instruction set architecture (ISA) known as RISC-V in 2010. Grounded in reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles, it’s a common, open-source, and completely free ISA that can be used to develop software and hardware. These attributes are just part of what makes the architecture unique and attractive to developers and manufacturers.

While it’s far from new, momentum around RISC-V is continuing to accelerate, with various services, technologies, and products that leverage this architecture emerging in the past year alone. According to Deloitte, use of RISC-V’s open-chip processors was expected to double this year and is set to double again in 2023 - [EEWorld](https://www.eeworldonline.com/risc-v-background-benefits-and-future-faq/).

## What We Can Learn From Vintage Computing

[![What We Can Learn From Vintage Computing](../assets/20221220/20221220vintage.jpg)](https://github.com/readme/featured/vintage-computing)

Thanks to open source, no technology ever has to become obsolete, so long as a community remains to support it. You can sync Newtons and Palm Pilots with modern desktops, download web browsers for long-discontinued operating systems, [replace a 6502 with a Teensy](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/14/a-teensy-4-1-powered-drop-in-upgrade-for-commodore-64-vintagecomputing/), or connect vintage computers like the Apple IIe to the modern internet via WiFi. Every year, new cartridges are released for old-school video game consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy - [The ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme/featured/vintage-computing).

## This Week's Python Streams

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221220/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **395**!
