Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! No sooner than PyCon US wrapped up, there was a flood of MicroPython news. On it's tenth anniversary, version 1.20.0 was released with many exciting features. It's never been a better time to try / work with Python to program microcontrollers and single board computers. I'm looking forward to everyone flying home and putting some of their Python knowledge to good use - whether commercially or as open source. What are you working on? Be sure to let us know at cpnews(at)adafruit(dot)com. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## MicroPython v1.20.0 Released

[![MicroPython v1.20.0 Released](../assets/20230502/20230502mp.png)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases)

MicroPython v1.20.0 has been released and it contains a wide array of improvements and fixes. Of particular note, it has a new lightweight package manager called mip, which uses a custom protocol to query and install packages that is optimised for embedded systems. It is intended to take over the role of upip and supports installing packages from micropython-lib as well as any URL. The Raspberry Pi Pico W is now supported with WiFi. See all the changes - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases). [Download](https://micropython.org/download) and [GitHub Discvussions](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/11342).

> "...there is a lot more coming in the pipeline. MicroPython is part of Google's Season of Docs for the third time so there will be even more improvements to the documentation in the coming 6 months. There is work on some new hardware targets, and we intend to put more effort into the zephyr port. We would also like to make progress this year towards MicroPython v2.

CircuitPython support for DVI 'Bell works with Wifi on Pico W. Adafruit is testing it with CircuitPython *and* WiFi support: so they're able to connect over the internet with SSL to a site, get data, and then display it on a monitor. Since the Pico W requires a lot of memory for the wireless connectivity, they're using monochrome DVI output which means there is about 50K remaining after the framebuffer is allocated for the DVI display. CircuitPython supports 1, 2 or 8 bit color, which you can configure based on your memory availability - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1651222390511206411).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230502/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.1.0-beta.2 on April 26, about four weeks after the previous beta release. We are making steady progress towards 8.1.0 final.

[![Show and Tell](../assets/20230502/20230502dan.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcw8rOYaO8U)

I was on [Show and Tell](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gcw8rOYaO8U?feature=share&t=80) on Wednesday, showing off a simple demo of the upcoming Adafruit Feather RP2040 Prop-Maker, which is another RP2040 "Bones" board. This Feather features a 5v level-shifted NeoPixel pin, an LIS3DH accelerometer, an I2S audio amplifier, a servo pin header, and an extra GPIO you can use to attach a button or switch, or whatever). The NeoPixel strip connections, the speaker, and extra GPIO are all screw terminals, so you don't need to do any soldering. *(Ed: makes for a nice lower cost lightsaber, etc.)*     

**Tim**

This week a few members of the team were off at PyCon and sprints were occurring with many new contributors picking up issues for the first time and submitting PRs. I've been spending time during the week reviewing the increased amount of submissions.

**Scott**

The PicoDVI support was merged in last week. It is in 8.1.0-beta.2. Beware that the API will change a little bit before 8.1.0 stable due to feedback from folks using it.

I also fixed an e-paper display issue due to incorrect byte order in addresses. This impacts SSD1675, SSD1680 and SSD1681 as far as I know. The fix is in CircuitPython core but the libraries also need to be updated.

Now I'm back to my i.MX RT work. I'm adding support for more versions of the chip. I'm also speeding up the flash chip speed and getting about a 20% performance boost on the benchmarks.

## Upcoming events!
