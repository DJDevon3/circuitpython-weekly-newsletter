PyCon US 2022 is this week. The event is in-person with an online component from April 27, 2022 – May 5, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah USA. Head over to the [PyCon US 2022 website](https://us.pycon.org/2022/) for details about the conference and the schedule – [PyCon Blog](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2022/10/pycon-us-2022-website-and-sponsorship.html).

Kattni, Melissa and Jeff from Adafruit will be attending April 28th through May 3rd. Kattni and Melissa will be attending the Education Summit on April 28th. Kattni will be giving a talk at the Summit called Simplicity and Fun: Learning with CircuitPython. The team will also be hosting a Welcome to CircuitPython mini-sprint.

They will be hosting Open Spaces every day (time TBD), which will be an introduction to CircuitPython using the Circuit Playground Bluefruit (CPB). The Bluefruit boards will be provided, along with a few other accessories, to enable folks to explore CircuitPython. A quick-start will be available, as well as a series of other examples to delve into. All three team members will be available to help.

Kattni and Melissa will be hosting development Sprints May 2nd and 3rd - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/18/looking-forward-to-pycon-2022-python-pyconus-pycon/) and the [Open Spaces GitHub](https://github.com/kattni/PyCon2022).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220426/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **351**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_MotorKit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MotorKit)
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_VC0706](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_VC0706)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am continuing to work on an ESP32-S2 I2C issue, and am working with an Espressif engineer on a possible solution.

I'm tuning up the NeoPixel timings on various ports to be able to support all the different kinds of NeoPixels we sell.

I've been shepherding several pull requests from some new contributors to CircuitPython through the review process.

**Jeff**

I noticed ["Servo 2040", a new board from pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/servo-2040) appeared in [the Adafruit shop](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5437). This prompted the question of what it would take to support 18 servo motors at the same time in CircuitPython on the RP2040. It turns out that it should be possible with a small addition to the StateMachine class, and I have a [work in progress Pull Request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6300). This may also unlock sending data to a PIO peripheral "in the background" from CircuitPython code, which is cool and will no doubt find uses.

In this image, 4 staggered "servo-like" signals are shown. The code adapts to any number of contiguous pins using just one StateMachine.

[![Signals](../assets/20220426/20220426jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday look for me at PyCon US 2022 in Salt Lake City. I'd be happy to talk with folks from the community, especially at the CircuitPython open spaces. I made myself a custom badge from a pygamer just for the occasion, so you can pick me out in a crowd.

[![PyGamer Badge](../assets/20220426/20220426jeff2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Kattni**

This week I published the Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather guide. Much of it is tied to the ESP32-S2 Feather guide, as the boards are heavily similar. If you picked up one of the ESP32-S3 Feathers, and you're wondering where to start, check out this guide.

I am also working on testing PyLeap. PyLeap is an iOS app that allows you to connect to your Circuit Playground Bluefruit or CLUE board (in the unreleased beta version) from your iOS device, and download and transfer code from a number of Learn guides wirelessly to your board. I'll be working with our developer to get into a bug-fix cycle and get through what I found. Keep an eye out for the next PyLeap update!

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on a script that would install the MIPI driver for the raspberry pi including figuring out all the offsets and rotations to match the existing FrameBuffer-based drivers. I started working on trying to separate the touchscreen functionality from the old driver and while it does show up, I am still unable to receive touch events.

This next week I'll be at PyCon US - at the conference, open spaces, and at the sprints. If you are also attending, be sure to look for me there.

**Tim**

This week I tested a few network based PRs, to support multiple cookie headers, and try multiple ssid's if suplied in secrets.py for projects that utilize PortalBase. I addressed some feedback received on my core PR to allow TileGrids to have their bitmap changed after initialization as well as re-tested all of the behavior and argument validity checking. In preperation for that to be merged I started working on a SpriteButton class that will allow us to easily make fully custom bitmap buttons that can have separate sprites for pressed and un-pressed states. I did the final round of editing and on the typing information guide page and submitted it for moderation. It's been published and I'll be blogging it soon.

**Liz**

I'm starting to work on a Laser Harp project. I'll be using 8 time of flight sensors to "play" the harp. The harp will output MIDI and I'll be using a combination of detecting when my hands are over a ToF sensor and using the distance to affect CC values. I'm leaning towards including a Music Maker FeatherWing so that it can be a standalone synth.

This is going to be a larger project so I will also be working on documenting a quick USB to serial MIDI converter with a QT Py and CircuitPython. This was a project done by Sandy Macdonald on Twitter and we thought it would be great to document for the community.
