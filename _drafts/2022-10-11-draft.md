## CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W Hits Version 8-beta.1

[![CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20221011/20221011picow.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/)

Work on the CircuitPython support for Raspberry Pi Pico W has reached the point where it has been released on circuitpython.org. While not feature complete in CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.1, it is useable for several types of WiFi use. It is currently being actively worked on by Adafruit - [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/).

Liz posts about trying out WiFi on Pico W - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BlitzCityDIY/status/1578188289097764865).

## Linux 6.0 arrives supporting newer chips, core fixes, and more

[![Linux 6.0 arrives](../assets/20221011/20221011linux.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/04/linux-6-0-arrives-supporting-newer-chips-core-fixes-and-more-linux-arstechnica/)

A stable version of Linux 6.0 is out, with 15,000 non-merge commits and a notable version number for the kernel. And while major Linux releases only happen when the prior number’s dot numbers start looking too big—”there is literally no other reason“ — there are a lot of notable things rolled into this release. 

Lenovo’s ThinkPad X13s, based on an ARM-powered Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, get some early support in 6.0. ARM support is something Linux founder Linus Torvalds is eager to see and believes that more people using Linux on ARM devices leads to more bug reports, more patches, and more enthusiasm - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/04/linux-6-0-arrives-supporting-newer-chips-core-fixes-and-more-linux-arstechnica/) and [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/linux-6-0-arrives-with-support-for-newer-chips-core-fixes-and-oddities/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221011/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!
