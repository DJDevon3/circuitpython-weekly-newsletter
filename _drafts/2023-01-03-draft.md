Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Happy New Year! We found some CSS issues in the Newsletter template, which hopefully have been corrected, making it easier to read each week. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Pybricks Brings MicroPython to LEGO Controllers

[![Pybricks](../assets/20230103/20230103pybricks.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/29/pybricks-run-micropython-easily-on-lego-controllers-lego-micropython-laurensvalk/)

Pybricks is Python coding for smart LEGO® hubs. You can run MicroPython scripts directly on the hub and get full control of your motors and sensors.

Pybricks runs on LEGO® BOOST, City, Technic, MINDSTORMS®, and SPIKE®. You can code using Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android.

You can restore the original LEGO firmware with ease. This is very well coded and it even has a dark mode!

## A Keyboard Made Entirely with Python

[![Keyboard as a Python Code](../assets/20230103/20230103key.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/project/188907-keyboard-as-a-python-code)

Python is one of the best programming languages, it can do everything. So hsgw designed an entire keyboard, including the PCB, case, and firmware (KMK/CircuitPython) using only Python. No need to use Kicad and Fusion360. It is explained in a Jupyter Notebook (Google Colaboratory or binder), and it can be customized.

**Goals**

* Design not only the firmware, but also the schematic (netlist), PCB, and case all in Python.
* The code is explained in a runnable Jupyter Notebook (Google colaboratory) environment.

Banana Pi Release New Raspberry Pi Pico Alternative - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/banana-pi-release-new-raspberry-pi-pico-alternative).

> Programming the Banana Pi BPI-Pico-RP2040 is a straightforward process. Officially we have the choice of MicroPython and Arduino. Being an RP2040 based board there are other alternatives, such as TinyGo, Rust and CircuitPython. Right now there are no official versions crafted for the Banana Pi BPI-Pico-RP2040 but an eager community will soon port them.

[![Adafruit SCORPIO](../assets/20230103/20230103scorpio.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/banana-pi-release-new-raspberry-pi-pico-alternative)

When Adafruit saw the new “PIO” feature of the RP2040 from Raspberry Pi, they knew it would be perfect for driving huge numbers of NeoPixels. So they created the Adafruit Feather RP2040 SCORPIO specifically for NeoPixel (WS2812-compatible) control, but also good for various other PIO-based projects that want to take advantage of the Feather pinout with an additional 8 consecutive outputs (or inputs) - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-feather-rp2040-scorpio/overview).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

We closed three issues for 8.0.0 but potentially have three new ones, making for six as of this writing.

I spent several days debugging a mysterious problem that caused `-O2` optimized builds to fail on SAMD builds. At first it seemed to be a USB-related problem, but it turned out that incorrect data was being reported back to the USB host, causing it to think that CIRCUITPY was much larger than it actually was, which caused a crash. After I fixed that, CircuitPython stopped crashing but the CIRCUITPY drive appeared to be corrupted and so was not mounted. I tried to narrow down the problem further, trying and discarding various theories such as delays not being correct, or variables not being `volatile`. The problem turned out to be related to disabling and enabling the microcontroller's memory cache during external flash operations. I added "memory fence" operations around the cache operations, and that fixed the problem. This was about as low level as the previous week's difficult bug, which involved compiler assumptions about register use.

**Tim**

I assembled the pico cowbell sequencer device designed by community member DJDevon3. I've been working on software for it. Learning about USB Midi output and starting to make a control scheme for choosing which notes get sent for each of the indexes in the sequence. I've got a few ideas in mind for adding a display to the sequencer, perhaps with a second micro-controller.
