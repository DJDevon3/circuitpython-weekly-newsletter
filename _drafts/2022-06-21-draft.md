Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! 

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## MicroPython 1.19 Released

[![MicroPython 1.19](../assets/20220621/20220621mp119.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.19)

[MicroPython](https://www.micropython.org/) v1.19 was just released! The release has seen a big change to the format of MicroPython's .mpy files. These files - which contain precompiled bytecode - now contain mostly static data which is ready to execute without any changes (previously a lot of linking steps were required when importing .mpy files). This simplifies things and improves import speed, and most importantly will soon allow you to easily "freeze" precompiled bytecode into a linear filesystem, without needing to rebuild the main firmware. This dynamic freezing feature will be available in a future release.

There are many other enhancements, fixes and additions in v1.19, including a new port to Renesas RA microcontrollers. One neat addition is the ability to customise the REPL prompt (the >>> part) by setting sys.ps1 (and sys.ps2) to whatever string you like. This can be very useful to distinguish different boards, by making sys.ps1 unique on each of them. For example "D2> " on a PYBD-SF2, or "RP> " on a RP2040-based board - [Release Notes](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.19), [Changelog](https://micropython.org/resources/micropython-ChangeLog.txt), [Forum Post](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=12557&p=68013#p68013) and [Downloads](https://micropython.org/download).

Community member and CircuitPython contributor [Tammy Cravit](https://github.com/tammymakesthings) is streaming on Twitch. Her stream focuses on electronics, coding and making, with a focus on CircuitPython. The first few streams have been working on a [MacroPad](https://adafruit.com/product/5128)-based MIDI controller, and she's got lots of other project ideas in the works. An exact schedule for her streams is still being worked out, but she's targeting 2-3 streams per week.

## Coming Soon

[![STEMMA QT / qwiic hub](../assets/20220621/20220621hub.jpg)](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1536745853301534720)

Adafruit STEMMA QT / qwiic hub - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1536745853301534720).

> We had a request on the forum for a vertical-JST-SH I2C hub. most of our boards have two ports for chaining I2C but there could be a good reason for wanting a star-topology as well, for example reducing voltage droop or to fit in a small enclosure.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220621/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!
