Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter!  - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 5 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 5 Released](../assets/20221213/20221213cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/07/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-5-released/)

CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.5 has been released. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions, fixes, and changes before final release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/07/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-5-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.0.0-beta.5).

WARNING: The flash partitioning for 2MB and 4MB flash ESP32 and ESP32-C3 boards has changed since 8.0.0-beta.2. When you load 8.0.0-beta.3 or later over beta.2 (or vice versa), on these boards, CIRCUITPY will be erased and reformatted.

WARNING: The flash partitioning for the Raspberry Pi Pico W has changed since 8.0.0-beta.1. When you load 8.0.0-beta.2 or later over beta.1 (or vice versa), on the Pico W, CIRCUITPY will be erased and reformatted.

**Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0**

* Added WiFi workflow with browser-based device discovery, filesystem browsing, upload, download, file editing, serial/REPL connection (available on Espressif and, as of 8.0.0-beta.5, Pi Pico W).
* Added a one-line status bar, which displays connection status, last exception, and version on a terminal window title or on the top line of an attached display. Mu 1.2.0 and Thonny 4.0.x and later are able to suppress status bar information in the REPL output.
* `.env` file in CIRCUITPY specifies WiFI connection parameters, BLE name, and other startup values.
* `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values are set by values in `.env` file. Values can be fetched from other `dotenv`-format files.
* WiFi functionality implemented on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* Revised Espressif camera support, now available on ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3.
* Bulk analog input: `analogbufio` (available only on RP2040 for now).
* Pin state can be preserved during deep sleep (available only on Espressif for now).
* Allow setting USB VID, PID, manufacturer, and product ids at runtime.
* Enabled `collections.deque` on most builds.
* `MP3Decoder` and `WaveFile` can now take a filename instead of an open file.
* `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
* In-place firmware update (`dualbank`) capability may be disabled in favor of a larger CIRCUITPY drive.
* Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
* Added `os.utime()`.
* Added `coproc` module, for running programs on an on-chip co-processor. Currently available for the RISC-V core on the ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3.
* A serial “break” on the USB or UART REPL serial connection will cause a `KeyboardInterrupt`, like ctrl-C. The advantage over ctrl-C is that the break interrupts even if the input buffer is full.
* Add `hidden` property to `vectorio` shapes.
* Add native `\_pixelmap.PixelMap` support, for speed.
* Chained exceptions are now implemented.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.5 on Wednesday, December 7. It includes changes from about 80 pull requests. I'll probably do another beta soon with the API and environment setting changes being done by Scott and Jeff.

I've fixed several minor 8.0.0 issues, and also investigated and closed some issues that no longer seem to be a problem. I also moved a few issues to a longer timeline. As of this writing, we have only 11 issues left for 8.0.0: we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel!

**Kattni**

The [Intro to the Mastodon API](https://learn.adafruit.com/intro-to-mastodon-api-circuitpython) guide has been published! There's info on how to obtain your Mastodon API access token, and two CircuitPython examples that show you how to read from and write to Mastodon. If you're interested in using CircuitPython to interact with Mastodon, check out this guide!

Next up is the product guide for the EYESPI breakout. If you picked up one of these boards, and you want to know more details and help getting started, keep an eye out for that!

**Tim**

I started working on updating Blinka_Displayio API to match the new core APIs but ran into trouble in my development environment that I wanted to get sorted before I got into the Blinka_Displayio code, that's resolved now and I've started to dive in, but still have more work to do. I also did library PR reviews and testing, the main one was for typing in the wiznet Ethernet library.

**Jeff**

I've continued working on issues and bugs we'd like to see resolved before version 8.0 comes out. The biggest item is the replacement of ".env" with "settings.toml". This means that in the next beta you'll need to change where your Wifi Workflow settings are. We'll have updated documentation to reflect this change.

I also wrote another keyboard guide; check out the link elsewhere in the newsletter.

**Scott**

I've refined the `audiobufio` API and it is in beta.5. I also fixed a bug with the web workflow on ESP32s where it didn't respond very quickly. Now it is snappy and a pleasure to use.

From there, I've been working on refining the `coproc` module that was added to support the ultra-low-power processor on the ESP32-S2 and S3. I've tweaked it to have an `espulp` module and a generic `memorymap` module. It all compiles and I'm working to get it tested with a few examples. My goal is to make it easy to share programs to run on the coprocessor.

**Liz**

I wrote up a guide on the [QT 5V to 3V Shifter Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-5v-to-3v-shifter-breakout). It's an easy way to shift down to 3V logic from 5V logic boards. I also worked on the [Introduction to the Mastodon API using CircuitPython guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/intro-to-mastodon-api-circuitpython) with Kattni. I wrote the code examples and code explanations. I hope it will be a helpful resource for folks if they want to experiment with the Mastodon API.
