## Continuous Capacitive Touch Controller Circuit Boards

[![Capacitive Touch Controller Circuit Boards](../assets/20230704/20230704captouch.gif)](https://twitter.com/bradanlane/status/1674211302074376200)

Bradán Lane is making a set of I2C add-on board (similar to the Adafruit seesaw series). The latest one has a circular and square sensor area with multiple elements, allowing for continuous touch sensing - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bradanlane/status/1674211302074376200).

> The circle uses 3 interwoven touch sensors to create a continuous value (0..255 or 0..359). The grid uses 12 diamond touch sensors (6 rows & 6 columns) to create a continuous X-Y pair (0..255 0..255). The actual touch controllers are driven by an ATtiny1616 and expose high level I2C client interface.

An Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather running CircuitPython is used to read the I2C data from the board and provide output via the serial REPL. 

## This Week's Python Streams

## Project of the Week: Olga The Fortune Teller

[![Olga The Fortune Teller](../assets/20230704/20230704fortune.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/olga-the-fortune-teller-the-magpi-131/)

[![Olga The Fortune Teller](../assets/20230704/20230704fortune2.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/olga-the-fortune-teller-the-magpi-131/)

Olga The Fortune Teller is a new Raspberry Pi project by Rosie Hattersley. It's a shiny new ChatGPT model designed to appeal to the Insta-savvy influencer keen to check out both the latest skincare options and receive reassuring messages about their future fame and follower count  - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/olga-the-fortune-teller-the-magpi-131/).

> ...mobile connectivity was vital, so they chose a (Raspberry Pi) Pico W: “simple, low-cost and small but, at the same time, [it] can run a full wireless stack which is easy to use.” With MicroPython on the Pico W, things work painlessly and the development time is short. It’s used here to communicate with a Zebra thermal printer via an RS232 connection and prompt it to print out a stand visitor’s fortune ticket. ChatGPT is instructed to: ‘Pretend you are a fortune teller and tell the person you are talking to – who is called $NAME – their fortune in a poem of three or four short lines. Make sure their fortune is vague but positive! Include a lucky item (retail related).’

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230704/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **443**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.0 Release Candidate 0 on Friday June 23, and Release Candidate 1 on Tuesday, June 27. If all goes well, we'll release 8.2.0 final shortly after the July 4 holiday.

I've been continuing on the MicroPython merge. I am getting closer to finishing my initial review of all the changes. Then I'll work on getting it to compile and start testing.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Gamepad QT guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/gamepad-qt). If you picked up one of these nifty little STEMMA QT gamepads, check out this guide for all the details and code examples to get you started.

Next up is are guides for the STEMMA Audio Amp and Swirly Grid. Keep an eye out for those soon!

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on fixing bugs and adding features to the CircuitPython Code Editor. I also updated the 1.2" 7-Segment LED display backpack in the [Adafruit LED Backpacks](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack) Learn Guide.

**Tim**

This week I've been testing and putting finishing touches on a change for the ESP32SPI library to have a more compatible socket API as compared to CPython and other socket sources. The majority of this weeks testing was on learn guide projects that use higher level helper libraries to interact with the WiFi like PyPortal and Adafruit IO. I also tracked down an issue with `displayio.Shape` and submitted a fix for it.

**Jeff**

I improved audio output on RP2040-based boards including the Feather RP2040 Prop Maker, by working around a bug that would make a loud audio glitch each time files on the CIRCUITPY drive were updated. There's still a small glitch, but instead of being a loud noise it is a short period of silence.

During USB enumeration there is still a glitch, so adding a short delay before any program begins audio synthesis remains recommended to work around it.

**Liz**

This week I published the [EYESPI BFF guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eyespi-bff). This board has an EYESPI connector for connecting displays. I think folks will be able to make some fun, compact display projects with this. According to the backend stats in the Learn System, this guide was my 100th published guide, which I'm very proud of.
