## Adafruit Working on New Raspberry Pi Pico Add-on Boards: Bells

[![Proto Bell](../assets/20220719/20220719bell.jpg)](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1547065264579252224)

Adafruit is working on new add-on boards for the Raspberry Pi Pico form factor. Quote: "whenever we start making add-ons we always do a protoboard first, and so it is that this is Adafruit's first design for a Raspi Pico add-on. it's the simplest and 'cheapest' to start" - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1547065264579252224).

With a wide variety of names for add-on boards: shields, capes, FeatherWings, HATs, gizmos, etc., Adafruit wanted a name for their line of boards.

[![Bell](../assets/20220719/20220719bells.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UAl3oqVa9eY)

As the new Pico W is being dubbed the "Picow" by the community, cow-themed ideas are being used. Adafruit, after consideration, announced on their Ask an Engineer show, Top Secret segment, their add-on boards will be called "bells" (like cowbell) - [Adafruit Top Secret](https://youtu.be/UAl3oqVa9eY).

### The CircuitPython Show

[![The CircuitPython Show](../assets/20220719/cpshow.jpg)](https://circuitpythonshow.com/)

The CircuitPython Show is an independent podcast, hosted by Paul Cutler, focusing on the people doing awesome things with CircuitPython. Each episode features Paul in conversation with a guest for a short interview – [CircuitPythonShow](https://circuitpythonshow.com/), [Blog Post](https://paulcutler.org/posts/2022/01/introducing-the-circuitpython-show/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/circuitpyshow).

The show is off this week.  Last week featured Nicholas Tollervey, the creator of Mu and circup, and next week long time CircuitPython community member and contributor Kevin Matocha joins the show. [Show List](https://circuitpythonshow.com/episodes/all).

## Project of the Week: Picodeck

[![Picodeck](../assets/20220719/20220719picodeck.jpg)](https://github.com/DDRBoxman/picodeck)

Picodeck uses tinyusb to turn a Raspberry Pi Pico into a device that works with Elgato's Stream Deck software - [GitHub](https://github.com/DDRBoxman/picodeck).

> Colin Edwards wanted to control Elgato Stream Deck much like the official pedal sold by the company. Using Wireshark with the Elgato pedal helped to determine the communication method of the commercial hardware.

Based on the Adafruit tutorial [Three Button Foot Switch](https://learn.adafruit.com/three-button-foot-switch). You may read more on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2022/07/14/homebrew-stream-deck-pedal-emulates-the-real-thing/).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220719/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).
