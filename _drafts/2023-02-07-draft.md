## Project of the Week: EBike/EScooter modular DIY electronics using VESC and CircuitPython

[![EBike/EScooter modular DIY electronics using VESC and CircuitPython](../assets/20230207/20230207bike.jpg)](https://opensourceebike.github.io/)

[![EBike/EScooter modular DIY electronics using VESC and CircuitPython](../assets/20230207/20230207bike2.jpg)](https://opensourceebike.github.io/)

Over the years, Jorge Pinto owned a few different EBikes / EScooters from different brands, and found limitations with all of them, mainly on the software. Knowing that in general, all EBikes and EScooters are equal, Jorge decided to replace the original motor controller electronics and display, from different EBikes/EScooter vendors, with a modular DIY version and running custom software.

The resulting module uses the popular VESC for the motor controller and an ESP32 board running CircuitPython. It is programmed wirelessly with a phone or a PC (just editing Python text files) - [OpenSourceEBike.github.io](https://opensourceebike.github.io/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL9Jek3_hDg), [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSourceEBike/EBike_EScooter_modular_DIY/tree/main).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)

- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230207/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-rc.1 on January 29 and rc.2 on February 1. There will probably be an rc.3, with very minor changes, and then if that shows no showstopper issues, we should be able to release CircuitPython 8.0.0 final very soon!

I have also been working on non-CircuitPython issues. I diagnosed a rare power-down sequencing issue on a few boards. I am also looking at SAMD21 UF2 bootloader problems: the BOOTPROT (bootloader protection) fuses are not being set on some boards, and the bootloader should really be doing brownout protection.

**Kattni**

Wrapped up the EYESPI guide updates with Liz. Now we're onto the guide for the [Adafruit Reverse TFT Feather ESP32-S2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5345). This will be a big one, though it is very similar to the Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather guide. There are two basic differences: the battery monitor is a different chip, and (obviously) the display is on the bottom. If you picked up one of these microcontrollers, keep an eye out for this guide!

**Melissa**

This past week was pretty productive. I was able to finish working all of the bugs out of a Pull Request for the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) which improves the USB workflow. I also pulled the code that allows JavaScript to interface with the CircuitPython REPL and place it in [its own GitHub repository](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-repl-js).

After that, I finished up a Pull Request to add some initial code for the CircuitPython Installer in order to test CORS issues that I've been experiencing. Working with another team member, we were able to fix the CORS issues in a central place for the CircuitPython firmware and I'm just about finished fixing it with the bootloaders as well.

I also added a number of new boards to [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) that were added as part of the new CircuitPython Release Candidates.

**Tim**

I've been working on the IS31FL3741 driver this week. I submitted a PR for the library to allow it to work with the LED_Animation library for the RGB Matrix device. I'm also digging in to an issue in the core module driver implementation that caused it to have issues on builds newer than 7.3.3. I'm bisecting thru the commits between the known good and bad versions to find the relevant change then I'll try to submit a fix for it.

**Jeff**

I had a couple of small PRs to circuitpython this week. First, I added the missing D0/D1/D2 buttons to the Feather ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT. Second, I pulled in an update of ulab to fix several crashing bugs.

Most of my time over the last week was spent in the Arduino environment, working on adding a VT100-style terminal to Pico-DVI. This isn't released, as it needs some polish. (OK, a lot of polish). One interesting possibility would be to load one RP2040 with the terminal sketch and connect to it with a second board using busio.UART to create a text terminal on a nice 800x480 display.

**Scott**

Last week I submitted [a PR for Bangle.js 2 support and 7-color e-paper support](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/7497). Its been a fight to get the CI happy though because it adds secure DFU support for the Bangle.js 2.

In the meantime, I've been scratching an itch to create a low-cost logic analyzer. In fact, [the Scorpio](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5650) can be configured for *input*. I've gotten it working with the [sigrok-pico project](https://github.com/pico-coder/sigrok-pico). So, its been a matter of connecting the hardware and software pieces. Follow along with the [pysigrok](https://github.com/pysigrok/) project.

**Liz**

[![title](../assets/20230207/20230207liz.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I'm in the middle of a few projects right now. My main focus has been on an OctoPrint status viewer. Recently my partner setup OctoPrint for our printer and my first thought was could we do a CircuitPython project with it? Using Adafruit IO as an MQTT broker with the MQTT plugin, I was able to get a TFT Feather ESP32-S2 showing the current status of the printer (operational, connecting, offline, etc) and if a print was running, I displayed the progress for the print using the progress bar library. 

It was suggested that I try to send MQTT messages to OctoPrint from the Feather too, which I was able to do through Adafruit IO and the OctoPrint MQTT Subscribe plugin. I've also switched to the new reverse mount TFT Feather ESP32-S2, which has three input buttons. Now if the printer is idle, I can send cooldown, heat up and reboot messages and if a print is active, I can send pause, resume or cancel messages. This will be fully documented in a Learn Guide soon.
