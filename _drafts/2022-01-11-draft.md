## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220111/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Last week I [added some features to countio](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/5803), allowing counting of both rising and falling edges, and also added pullup/pulldown support. This week I wrote a simple example demonstrating using asyncio to control and vary a NeoPixel animation. Now I am working on some further bugs we should fix for the next release of CircuitPython.

**Jeff**

I've been pulled into the floppy vortex of winter 2021/2022. With some work-in-progress code, I can grab raw flux timings in CircuitPython, then take them to a desktop computer and decode MFM data with a second Python program. The ultimate goal is to allow read access to old DOS floppies directly in CircuitPython with `mount("/floppy", floppy)`

**Melissa**

This past week was short for me, but I started splitting the Blinka Displayio shared functions into a Display Core module. The transition is started, but due to the relatively small number of people that are actually using the system and the availability of much better graphics systems, it makes sense to not put any more work into the library, so I am leaving it to the community or whomever wants to use it to advance it more. The library can be found at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio.

I also started on a second project to generate a LittleFS file system using pure JavaScript. There were other projects that had made a wrapper around the c code, but no actual ports, so this will be the first port, though really only a partial one since only a subset of the features will be required. This will replace the NVM Generator that I had made last year since it will work on both the ESP32 and the ESP8266.

**Scott**

I'm just starting up after taking another long weekend for the holidays. My main goal this week is to wrap up the Raspberry Pi work for the time being and spend some time on the ESP32-S3. I've got a pull request out that adds Pi Zero support and hopefully fixes the SD card support along with it. The last thing I want to do is merge in Piunora support because I've already started. I should be able to get all of those changes out this week.

On New Year's Day I also kicked off #CircuitPython2022. I'm excited to see where folks would like CircuitPython to go. I'm going to do a retrospective on #CircuitPython2021 for my first stream of the year and then follow up with #CircuitPython2022 the following stream. So, please let us know when you post something by emailing circuitpython2022@adafruit.com. Thanks!
