## 400 CircuitPython Libraries!

[![400 CircuitPython Libraries!](../assets/20230124/20230124libs.jpg)](url)

This week, CircuitPython hit a huge milestone: There are now 400 libraries available for CircuitPython. This includes Adafruit written libraries and community contributed libraries. Number 400 is [DerBroader71/circuitpython_uuid4](https://github.com/DerBroader71/circuitpython_uuid4) by Tudor (DerBroader71 on GitHub), thank you Tudor for your first CircuitPython pull request and contribution! And thanks to all who contribute to CircuitPython - [Adafruit Blog](url).

## 3,000,000 THANKS! Celebrating 3 Million Orders at Adafruit – Thank You!

[![3,000,000 THANKS! Celebrating 3m orders @adafruit – thank you!](../assets/20230124/20230124mile.jpg)](https://adafruit.com/3millionorders)

On January 18, 2023 11:20am ET the 3,000,0000 order was placed at Adafruit for a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B – 4 GB RAM by Michael from Austin, TX! (We asked to make sure it was OK to post this) Michael, a real human, was able to get a Raspberry Pi which is extra special since we’ve worked really hard together to make sure makers, real humans, have been able to get units! - [Adafruit Blog](https://adafruit.com/3millionorders).

## New Video: Troubleshooting CircuitPython

[![Troubleshooting CircuitPython](../assets/20230124/20230124bp.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3hnFM2UHa4)

Troubleshooting CircuitPython installation, board, and Mu issues: A Guide for New Students. Here are some of what Professor Gallaugher has seen as common issues that his students have encountered, plus solutions - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3hnFM2UHa4).

## Raspberry Pi Pico vs. ESP32-S2 Speed Comparison Benchmark Using CircuitPython

[![Raspberry Pi Pico vs. ESP32-S2](../assets/20230124/20230124vs.jpg)](https://interte.com/2023/01/17/raspberry-pi-pico-vs-esp32-s2-speed-comparison-benchmark-using-circuitpython/)

Raspberry Pi Pico is compared to the ESP32-S2 in a speed comparison benchmark using CircuitPython - [interte](https://interte.com/2023/01/17/raspberry-pi-pico-vs-esp32-s2-speed-comparison-benchmark-using-circuitpython/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bTYQ_Jrpz6Y).

> So the ESP32 S2 needs 128% more current to run the script, but for 50% less time. In total, the Raspberry Pi Pico needed 10% less power to perform this task, which is not significant in my opinion. In short, the ESP32-S2 outperforms the Raspberry Pi Pico for single-core processing workloads. It costs more or less the same, it's $1 more expensive, it has more RAM, Flash memory, and of course WiFi, which the Raspberry Pi Pico lacks. The Raspberry Pi Pico, on the other hand, has two processing cores, but I believe that in more than 90% of our projects, the use of a second core is unnecessary.

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm continuing on several of the last few 8.0.0 bugs we have left to fix before a release candidate. I fixed a bug that showed up when making an HTTP server on Espressif chips: we were not making a socket non-blocking internally when we expected it to be non-blocking. I researched another apparent bug that turned out to be Windows C3 and PowerShell not setting DTR ready when opening a serial connection. So it wasn't actually a CircuitPython bug. And right now I'm trying to track down some mysterious wifi problems with very intermittent crashes.

**Kattni**

I updated the SHT40 guide, which is now the [SHT40 and SHT45 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sht40-temperature-humidity-sensor/), to include, surprise, the SHT45! The only difference between the two breakouts is that the SHT45 chip has a higher accuracy rating. There is no difference in wiring, code, or interaction. The only way to tell which chip you have is to read the text on your breakout board! If you've picked up either of these chips, check out the guide!

We have been releasing new revisions of our TFT and OLED displays with a ribbon cable connector dubbed the EYESPI connector. To that end, I'm writing up a new template covering the connector, its pinout, and how it works, that will be included in each of the guide updates. There will also be updates throughout the rest of the guide to reference it. Once I've updated one guide to what we want it to be, Liz and I will be splitting up updating the rest of the necessary guides, and new updates moving forward. If you have one of these new EYESPI displays, keep an eye on the original display guide for these updates.

**Tim**

This week I've been continuing testing of changes in the Wiznet ethernet library. There are still a few more but we're approaching "light at the end of the tunnel" for the PRs that were built up. I also received and soldered up an Eye SPI breakout + a few displays to start trying them out with displayio.

**Scott**

This week I've been debugging the (hopefully) last few bugs before 8.0.0. The most recent was an issue with the Pico W where the web workflow wouldn't start the first time after dragging the UF2 onto the device. This is was due to us misdetecting the reset reason as the watchdog (which occurs during an error.) Now it is detected as a software reset and web workflow will start up.

I've also been working on CircuitPython2023. [My post is on the Adafruit blog.](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/05/scotts-circuitpython2023-tannewt/) And I've been making [summary posts with links to others' posts](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/circuitpython2023/).

**Liz**

This week I published two more new product guides: [the STEMMA QT version of the PCA9546 I2C multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pca9546-4-channel-stemma-qt-multiplexer) and [the IoT Button with NeoPixel BFF](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-iot-button-with-neopixel-bff). The IoT Button BFF is another QT Py add-on board that has a chonky button designed with simple IoT projects in mind. I wrote up quick Adafruit IO examples for both CircuitPython and Arduino for the guide demoing how you could send data to IO and use the NeoPixel as a connection status indicator.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230124/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).
