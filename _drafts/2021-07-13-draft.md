## Mu 1.1.0-beta 5 is now out

[![Mu 1.1.0-beta 5](../assets/20210713/20210713mu.jpg)](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2021/07/05/beta5.html)

Mu 1.1.0 Beta 5 is now available on their [downloads page](https://codewith.mu/en/download). It is a beta release so it may contain bugs or unfinished features. Bug reports or feedback via GitHub is solicited. The Mu Team had hoped for a regular (fortnightly) release tempo. Due to the voluntary nature of Mu’s development and because some of the updates in this release were quite challenging, this release is a LOT later than the developers had planned - [Mu Blog](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2021/07/05/beta5.html).

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210713/20210713bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210713/20210713pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210713/20210713pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210713/20210713pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210713/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.4 on Thursday, July 8. There are still plenty of further improvements and fixes in the pipeline.

I've fixed some issues with audio and displays on the RP2040, but there is further work to do. There are some mysterious unwanted interactions between different uses of DMA. A DMA transaction that is seemingly finished can affect a following one adversely. I'm debugging this and learning more about the RP2040 in the process.

**Jeff**

This week I've been splitting my time between some low level core changes and a keypad project for the Adafruit Learning System..

The core changes will help us squeeze features we want in version 7 into the smallest boards like the Trinkeys. This has reached the pull request stage.

The keypad project is a calculator with 20 MX-style keys on a custom PCB & 3D printed enclosure, running CircuitPython. At the time of writing, I'm working on finishing up the guide.

**Kattni**

Last week was a short week for me. I started the MacroPad library and published the MacroPad guide. The guide has everything you need to get started with your new MacroPad, including detailed pinouts info, CircuitPython and Arduino examples, and downloads resources. The upcoming library will make using the features on your MacroPad with CircuitPython super simple. Keep an eye out for it to make your CircuitPython MacroPad projects even better!

I'm also working on getting `_pixelbuf` and `adafruit_pypixelbuf` in line to be drop in replacements for each other, and moving the `colorwheel()` function to its own native module in CircuitPython to make it even simpler to use. This will make `colorwheel()` available on most CircuitPython-compatible boards without needing to import it from Pixelbuf.

**Melissa**

This past week was a shorter week for me. I worked on adding some stability improvements to the WebSerial ESPTool, but ran into some complications and have put that on hold for the moment. I picked up working on a new guide using machine learning to detect cats on counters. I'll provide more details and a link to a guide soon.

**Scott**

I took a couple days off so I’ll be getting caught up and then picking up the [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org) work to add serial support as well. Then I should have all the pieces for testing and we can then rearrange everything to work better together. Thursday I recorded a Talk Python to Me podcast where Damien is a guest too. YouTube link for the stream is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKBmeFb7zHY).
