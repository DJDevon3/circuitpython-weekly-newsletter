## A New Version of CircuitPython 7 is Released

[![New Version of CircuitPython 7](../assets/20220726/20220726cp7.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

CircuitPython 7.3.2 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, and is a new stable release - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

Notable changes to 7.3.2 since 7.3.1:

- Adafruit MatrixPortal: restore `traceback`, which allows `asyncio` use.
- Always release displays during deep sleep.
- Update frozen libraries: fixes issues due to older libraries on certain AirLift boards.

## 35,000 thanks!

Friday August 19 (8/19/2022) is CircuitPython Day 2022, being designated the snakiest day this year! The day highlights all things CircuitPython and Python on Hardware.

Below is the latest on events that are developing. Firm times and additional events will be posted in subsequent posts.

Special events will be held during the day – the following is a summary of events known to date:

- A panel discussion with Kattni, Jeff, Dan, and Tim. Hosted by Paul Cutler. More details coming soon!
- A chat with Jeff, Dan and Kattni. This will be the third year in a row that Jeff, Dan and Kattni will sit down and chat about their involvement and latest favorite contribution to CircuitPython.
- Special Edition CircuitPython Themed Show and Tell, hosted by Liz Clark. Details are still being solidified, but start prepping your CircuitPython related projects if you’re interested in participating!

Foamyguy CircuitPython Day Game Jam Stream:

> On CircuitPython Day, I’ll be combining 2 of my favorite things, CircuitPython and Games. I will stream the making of a CircuitPython game jam game. My goal will be to make a basic but playable and fun game within the time constraints of a few hours, and I’ll be streaming the process. After the stream, I will publish the code to the game so folks can play on their own CircuitPython devices.

Maker Joey Castillo writes: "My philosophy for writing (hardware) drivers: do it in CircuitPython first. Then port it to Arduino. In Arduino you can get closer to bare metal, but CircuitPython is very easy to code in; the iteration cycle is just super fast because you save your code and it's immediately running on the device" - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1549801050714120196).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220726/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **359**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_SHT31D](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SHT31D)
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.3.2 this week. Itupdates ESP32SPI-related frozen libraries and fixes one minor MatrixPortal issue.

I'm continuing to debug ESP32SPI-related issues, which manifest with a variety of symptoms.

**Jeff**

I've been working on adding support for the original Adafruit Feather ESP32 in CircuitPython. It mostly differs from the more recent "version 2" by not having "PSRAM". This has proven not to be the easy task I hoped it would be, but hopefully with time the reason it's being tricky will come to light.

**Kattni**

I've still been working through WipperSnapper pages. Three out of four board guides are done, and the fourth one is close!

In CircuitPython news, I've been working on CircuitPython Day planning. CircuitPython Day is August 19, 2022 this year. We're still in the planning stages, but we're slowly solidifying the details. Check out what we have so far [here](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/07/20/announcing-circuitpython-day-2022-on-august-19th-circuitpythonday2022-circuitpython-python-copy/). You can keep an eye on that post for updates, as well as the latest blog posts that will come with each update. If you have any ideas, suggestions or interest in participating, please reach out via email at [circuitpythonday@adafruit.com](mailto:circuitpythonday@adafruit.com)!

**Melissa**

This past week I have been working with the [Edge Impulse Studio](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) software to see how it could help us with some upcoming machine learning projects.

I also had the chance to reacquaint myself with the code.circuitpython.org code that I had worked on in order to take a look at refactoring it a bit to add some more features.

**Tim**

This week I got the Hack Tablet ESP32-S3 building successfully and installed on the device. I created a multi-touch example with some colorful circles to show off the snappy capacitive touch screen. I also continued work on the Octopus game guide pages, and did some preliminary testing on some flip clock sprite assets for a new project.

**Scott**

**Liz**

This past week I wrapped up the [NAU7802 Pet Food Scale guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/nau7802-pet-food-scale). I'm excited about the calibration functionality and hope folks will find the code to be helpful for their own projects that require calibration for sensors. This project will also be used for another Learn Guide with Microsoft Azure that will be released soon.

I'm starting to work on a new project with the Ruiz brothers that involves AdafruitIO. We're going to build two displays with analog servos that "talk" to each other over AdafruitIO. You'll be able to position a servo on one display, it will send the message to IO, and then the second display will receive the message and update its servo position and vice versa. I have a proof of concept working right now with a QT Py ESP32-S2 and a Feather ESP32-S2 changing each other's onboard NeoPixel colors.
