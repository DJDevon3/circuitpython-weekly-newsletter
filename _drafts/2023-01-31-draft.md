## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Release Candidate 1 Released!

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Release Candidate 1 Released](../assets/20230131/20230131cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/29/circuitpython-8-0-0-release-candidate-1-released/)

CircuitPython 8.0.0-rc.1, a release candidate for 8.0.0, has been released. It is stable, and developers are making a release candidate for further testing before final release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/29/circuitpython-8-0-0-release-candidate-1-released/).

NOTE: Since 8.0.0-beta.6, the file for specifying startup values for WiFi, etc., is now called `settings.toml` instead of `.env`, and uses slightly different syntax. Use double quotes instead of single quotes. Further documentation is [here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/environment.html).

**Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0**

* Add WiFi workflow with browser-based device discovery, filesystem browsing, upload, download, file editing, serial/REPL connection (available on Espressif and Pi Pico W).
* Add a one-line status bar, which displays connection status, last exception, and version on a terminal window title or on the top line of an attached display. Mu 1.2.0 and Thonny 4.0.x and later are able to suppress status bar information in the REPL output.
* A `settings.toml` file in CIRCUITPY provides environment variable values. Some value names are read by CircuitPython to specify WiFi connection parameters, BLE name, and other startup values. But you can also use `settings.toml` to specify your own parameters for your programs. Values from `settings.toml` can be retrieved using `os.getenv()`.
* WiFi functionality implemented on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* Revised Espressif camera support, now available on ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3.
* Bulk analog input: `analogbufio` (available only on RP2040 for now).
* Pin state can be preserved during deep sleep (available only on Espressif for now).
* Allow setting USB VID, PID, manufacturer, and product ids at runtime.
* Enable `collections.deque` on most builds.
* `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
* In-place firmware update (`dualbank`) capability may be disabled at runtime in favor of a larger CIRCUITPY drive. This is the default.
* Add `TileGrid.contains()`.
* Add `os.utime()`.
* Add `espulp` module, for running programs on the ULP co-processor in Espressif chips.
* Add `memorymap` module for general though limited access to various memory regions.
* A serial “break” on the USB or UART REPL serial connection will cause a `KeyboardInterrupt`, like ctrl-C. The advantage over ctrl-C is that the break interrupts even if the input buffer is full.
* Add `hidden` property to `vectorio` shapes.
* Add native `_pixelmap.PixelMap` support, for speed.
* Chained exceptions are now implemented.
* Add `VfsFat.readonly` property.
* Add `memorymap` to allow access to raw memory locations (currently only on Espressif).

## The State of the Single Board Computer Interface Ecosystem, is it Time to Design a Standard

[![Single Board Computer Interface Ecosystem](../assets/20230131/20230131std.jpg)](https://hackaday.com/2022/10/05/the-state-of-the-sbc-interface-ecosystem-is-it-time-to-design-a-standard/)

Choice when it comes to single board computers - They can be had from well-established brands such as Arduino, Adafruit, or Raspberry Pi, or from a Wild West of cheaper Far Eastern modules. There’s an aspect to these boards which has evolved; certain among them have become de facto interface connector standards for hardware peripherals. Do these standards make any sense? The reason it hasn’t happened yet is probably that there’s been no immediate sales incentive for them to do so - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2022/10/05/the-state-of-the-sbc-interface-ecosystem-is-it-time-to-design-a-standard/).

## Project of the Week: A CubeSat using CircuitPython and MicroPython

[![CubeSat](../assets/20230131/20230131sat.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/25/harlow-college-builds-cubesats-with-students-using-the-raspberry-pi-pico-space-raspberrypi-micropython-circuitpython-ataylorfpga-raspberry_pi-pimoroni/)

First and second year engineering students at Harlow College (Harlow, Essex, UK) have been busy designing and building a new CubeSat platform, with the ultimate aim of getting their boards and designs in space, taking photos of the Earth and beaming them back to the classroom.

The CubeSat platform is based around the Raspberry Pi Pico, consisting of three parts to the design: an acquisition board loaded with a camera and various sensors and storage; a master controller board with a radio link; and a ground station containing a radio link and decoder software. All three boards use the Raspberry Pi Pico, and the software is written with a mix of MicroPython and CircuitPython across the three boards - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/25/harlow-college-builds-cubesats-with-students-using-the-raspberry-pi-pico-space-raspberrypi-micropython-circuitpython-ataylorfpga-raspberry_pi-pimoroni/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards, but a big batch is about to drop next week!

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I updated CIrcuitPython Espressif builds to use the latest v4.4 updates from Espressif for the ESP-IDF SDK. Unfortunately they do not fix our existing I2C or wifi problems, but it's good to keep up with the fixes that are available.

Scott, Jeff and I triaged the remaining open issues for 8.0.0 and pushed them to a later 8.x.x release. We have been working on a number of them, and have had difficulty reproducing some. They are not showstoppers. I will make an 8.0.0-rc.0 Release Candidate release, which should be available by the time you read this.

**Kattni**

This week was all about EYESPI updates. We've revised a number of our displays to have a flex cable connector called an EYESPI connector, that allows you to hook up these displays to your microcontroller without soldering them or using a breadboard. All of the revisions at this time have had their guides updated to explain the connector, show how to plug it in, and indicate what pins are used by that particular display. If you picked up an EYESPI display and want more details, check out the guide for your display!

**Melissa**

I worked on catching up with messages and wrapping up some of the code I had been working on previously.  This includes fixing some bugs for the CircuitPython Code Editor. I have mostly been focusing on fixing bugs and refactoring some of the code that I intent to reuse in the new CircuitPython Installer that I was working on a couple of weeks ago.

**Tim**

This week I tested out the remaining Ethernet library PRs with improved example, and socket class more closely aligned with CPython. I also started implementing the bitmaptools module for Blinka_Displayio. It will allow code that uses it to be more portable. Intrigued by a question from discord over the past weekend, I learned how to use the MagTag library in conjunction with the deep sleep / pin alarm wake up functionality and submitted a new example that illustrates it.

**Jeff**

I published a guide about converting the NeXT Computers mouse to USB HID with CircuitPython. Check it out on [the Adafuit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/next-bus-mouse-to-usb-hid-with-circuitpython).

**Scott**

[![Scott's Update](../assets/20230131/20230131scott.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week I've been working on adding 7-color (black, white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue) e-paper display support to CircuitPython. Along the way I've also added dither support to the Palette pixel shader for times when the colors aren't exactly the colors supported by the e-paper display. I'm receiving the 4" and 7" 7-color e-paper displays today and will add support for them as well.

**Liz**

I worked with Kattni to add a page to the (display guides that now have EYESPI connectors)[https://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=eyespi]. She wrote a great template page that explains the connector and shows what pins are broken out to EYESPI for each display.

I currently have a few projects in the works, some collaborations and one solo, that will be published in the coming weeks; all of which are using CircuitPython.
