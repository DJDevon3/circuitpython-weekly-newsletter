## Adding images and GIF videos (assets)

Please preface all asset filenames for an issue with the date in the format yymmdd then a unique string, re. 20220802neopixel.jpg

Please consider using JPG files for size.
* All images **must be <=550px wide**
* Please avoid letterboxed images, e.g. images with black bars.

For videos:

* Capture via https://twittervideodownloader.com/ if necessary
* Convert to GIF with https://ezgif.com/, max 550 px wide, **file MUST BE < 1MB in size**

To reduce GIF filesize, make them smaller or crop, say to <400px wide, and consider 5 seconds max.
